1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,085
How can gamification be applied in a way
that makes people happy? Fulfilled?

2
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:13,071
Flourishing individuals? To answer that
question, we need to look to the

3
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:18,085
discipline of positive psychology.
Positive psychology was developed most

4
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:24,028
notably by Martin Seligman who's at the
University of Pensylvania and also by

5
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:30,025
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. And I put his
name up there on the slide because that's

6
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:35,075
the only way that you're going to be able
to spell it. And, the idea of positive

7
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:41,018
psychology is that psychology generally is
about pathology. Is about what happens

8
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:46,014
when something goes wrong. Someone has
some abnormal mental situation that

9
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:51,053
doesn't allow them to think straight or
they're depressed. Or they are psychotic

10
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:56,054
in some way. And the question that
Seligman started asking was, well, why

11
00:00:56,054 --> 00:01:02,028
don't we look at the opposite? Why don't
we look at what makes people happy and

12
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:08,006
fulfilled? Why don't we look at what
things it takes to make people feel better

13
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:13,062
about themselves and to feel like they
have authentically happy, flourishing

14
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:18,093
lives, as opposed to just what happens
when something goes wrong. And so that's

15
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:24,385
what the discipline of positive psychology
looks at and it's the basis of large

16
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:29,485
volumes of research into many different
areas. It turns out that much of this is

17
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:34,080
very relevant to understanding the
implication of games and thus by extension

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,096
certain kinds of gamification. Jane
McGonigal in her book, Reality is Broken,

19
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:45,056
points to Seligman's work and in some of
her later presentations points to how

20
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:50,080
games directly can address all of the
elements of his framework for human

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,040
flourishing, which he calls PERMA, which
stands for Positive emotions, Engagement,

22
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,085
Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement.
And I won't go through each of them in

23
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:07,073
detail, but it should be obvious how each
of these elements, which Seligman says are

24
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:13,101
the five core aspects of being a
fulfilled, flourishing individual. Not

25
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:18,299
just happy in a kind of light short term
sense but truly successful as an

26
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:24,337
individual. It turns out that all five of
these elements clearly tie i nto things

27
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:30,302
that we've discussed as core elements of
games. Most of which, gamification, if

28
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:36,307
it's done right and thoughtfully, has some
opportunity to tap into. So, that's the

29
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:42,045
high level way that gamification and games
can actually promote human flourishing.

30
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:47,733
But I want to specifically talk about the
concept of flow, which is what the

31
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:53,611
Csikszentmihalyi's major contribution
because that ties in even more directly to

32
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:59,154
some of the game design concepts that I
have discussed around gamification. The

33
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:04,948
idea of flow is that there's a state that
we sometimes get into where we are so

34
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:11,784
engaged in what we are doing. That, time
seems to lose its meaning. We lose our

35
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:18,503
self in the activity. We are fully and
completely engaged to the fullest our of

36
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:24,613
our abilities. It's a state that is
wonderful. And it's a state, interestingly

37
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:29,991
enough, that occurs at least as often, in
work activities as it does in

38
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:35,211
entertainment or play activities. And
Csikszentmihalyi started many years ago to

39
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:40,173
investigate this kind of flow, they did
all sorts of situations. In musicians and

40
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:45,431
rock climbers, and financial analysts,
lots of people who have the same

41
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:50,921
characteristic kind of experience. And he
developed a set of theories around what it

42
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:55,797
takes to get into the flow state. Now,
it's not something that you can do

43
00:03:55,797 --> 00:04:01,095
automatically and directly. You can't say,
all right, I'm going to go into flow now.

44
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:06,523
It's something that happens organically
when an activity has certain

45
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:12,501
characteristics that are at a sufficient
level for that individual. But we can

46
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:18,540
think about what the characteristics are
of allowing flow to occur in a way that's

47
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:26,100
useful for games and gamification. So,
Csikszentmihalyi presents a chart that

48
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:33,588
looks at over time. What is the difficulty
level of a certain activity? How

49
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:40,926
challenging is it? And the idea here is
that, if the activity is too difficult up

50
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:48,615
here, it creates anxiety. It's too tough,
we can't succeed at it, it scares us off.

51
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:54,929
We get anxious about the activity. On the
other hand, if it's too easy, we get

52
00:04:54,929 --> 00:05:01,909
bored. Something that is way below o ur
activities is a sure recipe for boredom.

53
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:08,340
In the middle is what Csikszentmihalyi
talks about as the flow channel. So, if we

54
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:15,263
stay between these two boundaries and have
an activity that over time is constantly

55
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:21,677
not too easy, not too hard, that's where
we have the opportunity for flow.

56
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:27,688
Specially if our movement through this
channel is variable. If it's an

57
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:34,175
interesting activity that maintains its
challenge, it's not something that we just

58
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:40,054
get on autopilot and do. The challenge
ramps up as we move along but the system

59
00:05:40,054 --> 00:05:46,143
is designed to keep adapting so we never
go either too hard or too easy. So, that's

60
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:51,409
a key to achieving this notion of flow.
And therefore in game design, game

61
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:57,121
designers think a lot about tuning the
system so that for players it's neither

62
00:05:57,121 --> 00:06:03,811
too hard nor too easy and yet it keeps
inter it remains interesting and variable

63
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:09,648
throughout the process. To get to a few
more aspects of flow that Csikszentmihalyi

64
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:13,964
talks about, that are relevant here for
games and gamification, he says, flow

65
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:18,476
occurs when there are clear goals. And
we've talked about this in terms of the

66
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:23,430
fundamental definition of games and we've
talked about it in terms of the first

67
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,452
design criteria for designing a gamified
system. He, second he says, there needs to

68
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:32,966
be a balance between perceived challenges
and skills. That's the essence of the

69
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:37,550
chart I just gave you. But the important
thing here is to remember that these are

70
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,899
perceived challenges and perceived skills.
The game feels like it's just hard enough.

71
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:47,538
Whether it is in some objective way,
there's really no way to tell. The

72
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:52,693
question is, how do you feel about the
experience? And is it tuned in a way that

73
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:57,539
you feel like it remains habitually
interesting. And third, I've talked about

74
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:02,655
this a lot, feedback. Clear and immediate
feedback. And this is not feedback in the

75
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,773
pure behaviorist sense of you're just
learning from the experience and moving

76
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:12,558
along and creating an association,
creating some reinforcement. This is

77
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:17,879
feedback allowing you to get to the point
where you feel totally immersed in the

78
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,819
experie nce and have that wonderful
experience of flow. So, if you can

79
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:29,375
gamified systems to push more in this
direction, to activate the five areas of

80
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:36,429
flourishing that Seligman talks about and
to maintain the requirements for flow that

81
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:42,871
Csikszentmihalyi talks about, you will
create a system that is deeper and more

82
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:50,070
rewarding than any kind of extrinsic
external motivator can ever be.
