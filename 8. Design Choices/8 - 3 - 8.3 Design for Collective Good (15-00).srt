1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,096
If you've decided that gamification is a
good approach to use for your business

2
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:11,018
challenge, how do you ensure that you're
doing it in a thoughtful, deep,

3
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:17,823
substantive, meaningful way? The best way
I can think of to illustrate this is to

4
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:23,710
give you a detailed example of a service
that uses all of the standard PBL type

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,838
game elements but pulls them together in a
coherent and consistent way to address

6
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:36,045
some of the deeper aspects of game design
and psychology and ultimately meaning. The

7
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:42,294
site is called Stack Overflow. It's part
of a larger group of sites now called

8
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:47,673
Stack Exchange. And I'm going to
intersperse screenshots of the site with

9
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:53,179
some quotes from Jeff Atwood who's one of
the founders of the site from a blog post

10
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:58,540
that he put out trying to explain how and
why he and his co-founder made design

11
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,793
decisions to implement gamification. Now,
an important point he makes is that when

12
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:09,026
the site was setup, he had no idea what
gamification was. And all these decisions

13
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:14,488
were not made based on gamification being
an interesting or cool design practice.

14
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:19,577
They were ways that he and his co-founder
trying to solve the challenges that they

15
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:24,486
had in front of them which just happened
to be the kinds of things that we now

16
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:29,660
think about as gamification. So, Stack
Overflow is a site for programmers. It's a

17
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,462
question and answer site where you can go
to ask questions about how to write

18
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:38,759
software or problems that you're having
with certain kinds of coding. And, other

19
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,750
people answer the questions. Well, that
doesn't seem terribly interesting, does

20
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,619
it? Asking and answering questions about
coding. In particular, how do you get

21
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:53,303
people to spend their own volunteer time
answering other people's questions,

22
00:01:53,303 --> 00:01:58,622
answering questions from total strangers
about how to code certain things. Well, it

23
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:04,402
turns out that Stack Overflow has been
tremendously successful at this very task.

24
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:10,346
The site or the collection of sites now
that they've put together, have over two

25
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:16,148
million registered users. They average
over 5,000 new questions per day and over

26
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:22,256
10,000 new answers per day on the si te.
So, they've been able to motivate people

27
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:28,965
to engage in this practice. And the
question is, how have they been able to do

28
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:35,157
that? Well, the first reason is by
thinking about the problem in the right

29
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:41,730
way. What is programming? Well, you can
look at programming as the example of

30
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,010
something very dull and rote. You can look
at answering questions about programming

31
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,148
as something inherently boring, and
difficult. Or you can look at it as

32
00:02:56,148 --> 00:03:01,672
something cool and wonderful and magical
and game-like. And that's the approach

33
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:06,668
that the designers of the site took. So
Atwood says, "The field of programming is

34
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:11,127
almost definition, by definition one of
constant learning." Learning as we talked

35
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:16,401
about has a great affinity for games. And
he said, "Programming is, supposed to be

36
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:21,292
fun." Says who? Well, says them. And
obviously says a lot of other programmers.

37
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:25,723
And to the extent that you can take this
approach, and think of what you're doing

38
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:31,399
as fun, then it naturally leads towards a
gamified approach that's authentic, that's

39
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:36,716
not just based on how do we make people do
this thing which otherwise they wouldn't

40
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:41,098
want to do. How do we come up with a whole
bunch of rewards that we'll dangle in

41
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:47,018
front of people, a bunch of big carrots or
a bunch of bit sticks that will get them

42
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:52,063
to do the thing. This approach says, well,
how do we think about the problem in a way

43
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:58,007
that makes the people feel like they want
to do it themselves? If it is fun, if you

44
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:03,031
can find the fun in any problem as Mary
Poppins says, then snap, it becomes a

45
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:07,845
game, and people will want to do it
voluntarily. So, that's the first aspect

46
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:12,361
of what they've done. Second aspect of
what they've done, is to implement a

47
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:17,449
system that is reflective of their
community. Know your players. Understand

48
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:23,083
what the community is that's involved in
the activity. And this is particularly

49
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:28,098
important because meaning is socially
constructed in communities. What's

50
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:34,070
meaningful? What's important is not the
same from every community to every other

51
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,662
community. It depends on the norms of
those groups and communiti es and that

52
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:45,085
kind of activity they're involved in. So,
take Foursquare's badges which we've seen

53
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:51,708
before. Very colorful. Very fun, if you
will, creative, graphical lots of little

54
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:59,259
inside jokes here and things like pumpkin
and so forth. These are badges that are

55
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:05,624
designed to be cool in their own, right?
Which is part of, of the whole Foursquare

56
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:12,265
mantra when they implemented these
gamified elements to get people to think

57
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:18,830
that checking in was somehow something fun
that they'd want to do. The badges in

58
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:26,243
Stack overflow look quite different. So,
here's a profile page of a user. This

59
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:32,733
happens to be a very high-level user. In
fact, he's one of the moderators who have

60
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:38,599
the extreme privilege of helping to run
the whole site. He's got 88,000

61
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:44,712
reputations points which is an awful lot.
And here are his badges. Just that. 52

62
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:51,196
gold badges, 224 silver badges, 434 bronze
badges. So you notice a very different

63
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:56,860
aesthetic here. This is a site for
programers, for geeks. So, it's about lots

64
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,837
of numbers, lots of information and not
lots of visual clutter. But just get to

65
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:08,036
the heart of the information right away.
Gold, silver, bronze. What those badges

66
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:13,775
are and what they mean. So, at a glance
you can see what this person's reputation

67
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:19,196
score looks like. So, two different ways
to do badges. Each one is appropriate for

68
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:24,534
the situation at hand. So, this is an
example of a stack overflow set of

69
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:30,037
questions and answers, there was a
question above and here is an answer from

70
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:35,947
someone talking about how to do something,
and here's the person who gave the answer.

71
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:41,989
This user Bahbu, and you can see this
person has 204 points and nine bronze

72
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:48,242
badges, a pretty low level user. And then
here, someone else has come in. This other

73
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:53,204
user, and that person has edited the
answer. And you see this person is a much

74
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:57,976
higher level user. They've got 9,000
points and a bunch of gold badges and so

75
00:06:57,976 --> 00:07:02,611
forth. Not quite at the level of Bill the
Lizard but a very much higher level user

76
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:07,812
and they have voluntarily edited the other
person's post. So, not o nly did that

77
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:12,880
person voluntarily come up with an answer,
they voluntarily modified and improved

78
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,581
upon someone else's answer. You see here
there's a, a link to improve the answer.

79
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:22,803
Well, that's really great. If the system
not only gets people to come up with their

80
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:27,260
own answers, but to improve that are
there, it's a self-reinforcing,

81
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,972
self-improving system. And here you see
another example of an answer that was done

82
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:37,897
by this person and then down below, some
dialogue back and forth by the person

83
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:42,914
doing the answer and the person posting
the question. Again, more information. The

84
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:47,589
question gets more precise. The answer
gets precise. More activity actually

85
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:52,999
improves the system. So, that's a really
great process. If you can design a system

86
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:58,269
that has those characteristics, it will be
very powerful. And the question is then,

87
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:03,298
so how does gamification do that for stack
overflow? Back to Atwood again. Stack

88
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:08,652
overflow, he says, is many ways my
personal Counterstrike. Now, Counterstrike

89
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:14,060
is a game, it was a modification of a game
called Half Life, which is an interesting

90
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,098
story in its own right. But the cool thing
about Counterstrike was that it was

91
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:24,060
structured around groups coming together
and having to fight as a team.

92
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,007
Counterstrike is a game where you're a
commando unit that's fighting against

93
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:33,072
terrorists. It's all about shooting at
things, using various different weapons.

94
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:38,037
But in Counterstrike, if you go off on
your own you're almost certainly going to

95
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:43,002
die. You need to group up with a bunch of
different people and some of them will

96
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:47,073
cover you as you move forward and will
take out snipers and so forth. You have to

97
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:52,014
work together as a team. And, that
activity is what made Counterstrike really

98
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:56,079
interesting and challenging for a lot of
gamers. Because it's harder to group up

99
00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:02,011
with people and all work together as a
team than just to go off on your own. And

100
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:07,088
Counterstrike implemented this in a really
interesting and compelling way so it was a

101
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:13,058
extremely successful game. And what Atwood
says is that notion of working together as

102
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:18,094
a team. T hat to win the game you have to
be effective, not just yourself but as a

103
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:24,347
teammate, as a part of a larger whole, was
the lesson that he and his co-founder took

104
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:29,071
to apply to questions and answers for
programming. So, the idea is, helping

105
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:37,022
fellow programmers is the way that you win
at the game. You don't win by being

106
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:43,038
awesome by yourself. You win by helping
other people. So, the gamified system is

107
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:48,086
structured in Stack Overflow relentlessly
to incentivize pro-social behavior. To

108
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:53,047
incentivize things like, as we saw,
improving on other people's answers as

109
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:58,022
opposed to just doing stuff purely
yourself in a way that doesn't help the

110
00:09:58,022 --> 00:10:04,003
group. So, let's look very quickly at some
of the ways that Stack Overflow structures

111
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:09,055
its game elements, to produce that same
Counterstrike like result, where people

112
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:15,027
are encouraged to work together in order
to win in the game. The first is that the

113
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:20,085
points in the system are actually called
reputation and the primary way you get

114
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:26,009
points is when your fellow users vote up
your questions and answers. So, not for

115
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:31,011
your actions but for other people saying
you did a good job. That's the core

116
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:36,019
definition of reputation in the system,
you have to do something other people

117
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,691
think highly of in order to get points.
Similarly, there is this structure in

118
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:45,899
Stack Overflow called bounties where you
can give reputation to someone for coming

119
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,064
up with an answer or good answer to a
question. That creates this notion of

120
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:56,079
exchange and gifting which is another very
powerful pro-social norm, that gets

121
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:02,008
activated by this game mechanic. So, all
of these game mechanics around the point

122
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:06,068
system are structured to reward not
individual achievement but things that

123
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:11,693
serve the collective good. And Atwood
talks about this as encouraging groups to

124
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:16,970
do what's best for the world rather than
their own specific selfish needs. Here, he

125
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,944
eludes to a wonderful article by Clay
Shirky called A Group Is Its Own Worst

126
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:26,674
Enemy, where Shirky points out that
there's this, there's this real problem

127
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:32,019
online, that we have really easy group
formation. You can form a g roup for

128
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:37,392
anything online, but the group tends to
fall apart because the group may have some

129
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:42,417
set of goals, there may be some set of
things that we can agree is in the group's

130
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:46,089
interest. But all the people who
participate in the group aren't the group.

131
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:51,047
They're individuals. And so they pull in
their own direction and the group, as it

132
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:55,029
grows, tends to fall apart and
disintegrate because it doesn't have

133
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:59,064
hierarchy and structure. The lack of
hierarchy and structure is what's great

134
00:11:59,064 --> 00:12:04,021
about online activities and online groups.
But they cause attention. And Atwood's

135
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:08,075
claim here is that game elements, game
stack overflow are what pull against that

136
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:13,074
natural tendencies of groups to collapse
into selfish interests. So, for example,

137
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:18,092
the reputation gives you certain powers,
but they are not just powers to go off on

138
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:24,004
to different parts of the site and lord
over people, they're powers that give you

139
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:28,097
abilities to be, essentially, a moderator
of the site, to engage in more of this

140
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:33,090
beneficial behavior on the site. And
that's cool, that's something you get with

141
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:38,083
reputation, but it's also something that
helps others. Similarly, Stack Overflow

142
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:43,082
has a badge system. But again, it's not
the Foursquare type of badge system where

143
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:49,055
the badges are about showing off your big
cabinet with all of your cool badges in

144
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:54,374
them. The badges are about doing things.
Some of them are just things that are good

145
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:59,054
for the site, visit every section of the
FAQ. But some of them are about things

146
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:04,333
that are good for others. Edit 100 posts
that have been inactive. Actively that,

147
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:09,327
that's not really one but here. Vote 300
times. Leave ten comments and so forth,

148
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:13,084
all social behavior. And this is
especially true of the gold badges, the

149
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:18,089
really cool badges that people are going
to want, there you have to do things like

150
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:23,069
edit 500 posts. Remember, editing a post
is the thing that's most beneficial in

151
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:28,463
terms of improving the quality of the site
collectively. But the thing that people

152
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:33,375
are least likely to do on their own. So,
use a badge to encourage people to do it.

153
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:38,550
Similarly g reat answers get you a gold
badge but so do great questions and so do

154
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:44,268
questions that are famous that are viewed
by lots of people. So, all of these are

155
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:49,453
different ways of incentivizing the very
things that are in the interests of the

156
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:54,876
site, in the interests of the group as
opposed to just incentivizing the things

157
00:13:54,876 --> 00:14:00,500
that make, make people feel individually
cool. And Attwood ultimately talks about

158
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,955
this as the game elements being in service
of a higher purpose. He said it ultimately

159
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:11,219
helps him become more knowledgeable and a
better communicator while improving the

160
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:16,623
very fabric of the web for everyone. Now,
not every gamified site can credibly claim

161
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:21,194
to improve the fabric of the web for
everyone. If it's purely a marketing site

162
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:25,350
that's trying to get more customers
engaged, it's hard to see this as

163
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,992
something that is fundamentally making the
internet a better place. It's not

164
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:34,901
necessarily in conflict with it. But as
long as you can push in that direction.

165
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:41,291
Try to find things that are meaningful and
fun for people, but also try to find ways

166
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:46,964
to have the gamification elements pushed
towards cooperation, collaboration and

167
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:52,380
larger good, larger purpose, that notion
of relatedness and self-determination

168
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,359
theory, the more likely is the gamified
site will be deep and significant and
