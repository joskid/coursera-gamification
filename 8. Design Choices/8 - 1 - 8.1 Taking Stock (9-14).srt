1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,037
I've thrown a lot at you in the course so
far. And truth be told, if this were say,

2
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:10,088
an enterprise workshop on gamification, I
would have stopped after the last section.

3
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:16,032
You've got all the basic concepts. You've
got a design framework. You've got all of

4
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:21,014
the components necessary to apply
gamification successfully. But because

5
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:26,066
this is a course, I want to go deeper. I
want to push you to think about some of

6
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:32,045
the conceptual issues around gamification
and some of the big, deep questions about

7
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:37,097
its future and about different ways to
implement it. And so, this is a good point

8
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:43,047
in the course to take stock. At a high
level about just what gamification is.

9
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:49,060
Because it turns out that, for many of the
reasons that I've talked about, there are

10
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,067
really two different kinds of
gamification. Two different things that

11
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:59,056
people mean when they use that word. Both,
to my mind, are true examples of

12
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:04,085
gamification and there certainly are
plenty of places which where they overlap,

13
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:10,041
some of which I'll illustrate but there
are very different answers that you get to

14
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:15,094
about gamification depending on which of
these two models you adhere to and people

15
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:21,017
use the same word gamification for both of
them and don't necessarily think about.

16
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:26,033
Which one they're following. The best way
that I can think of to divide these two

17
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:31,041
camps is to ask you the following
question. Is this a game? This slot

18
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:38,015
machine here which I've showed you before.
Is it a game? Well, if you use the

19
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:44,059
definitions of games that I gave you early
on in the in the course, probably not.

20
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:50,063
There's no sense of a game like or play
like attitude. There is no sense of

21
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:57,028
meaningful choices here. The slot machine
is just a big random number generator. You

22
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:03,020
pull the handle. That's it. And it either
gives you money or it doesn't. And whether

23
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,018
it gives you money or not is not based on
your skill and your play, it's just based

24
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:14,074
on a random, determination by the slot
machine itself. So, fundamentally, the

25
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:20,008
slot machine is no different then just
flipping a coin. Time after time after

26
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:25,019
time and seeing if you get heads or ta ils
and that's not really a game, is it? On

27
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:31,039
the other hand. Many of the examples we
have of social games, on social networks

28
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:37,010
online, as well as gamification, as I've
talked about, look a lot like the slot

29
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,004
machine. They create engagement loops
which pull in the user by the potential of

30
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:48,082
a reward. They involve surprise. They
involve trying to find a pattern. And many

31
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:54,098
people find them powerfully engaging in
many of the same ways that they find games

32
00:02:54,098 --> 00:03:00,080
powerfully engaging. So there's something
game like. About the slot machine, and we

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,007
call it a game of chance. But that's very
different from most of the types of games

34
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:11,131
that I described early on in defining what
makes something truly game-like. And I

35
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:16,081
think this is indicative of a broader
split within the notion of gamification.

36
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:23,002
There really are two different things
going on when we use the term. One, thing

37
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:29,037
could be summarized as being about doing.
Gamification is about doing things using

38
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:35,087
games and game-like structures. The other
approach, I can over-simplify by saying

39
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:41,074
it's about feeling. It's about not
necessarily what you do, but how you feel

40
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:47,023
about it. What's going on inside you? And
this leads to a variety of different,

41
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:53,297
decisions that get made. Implicitly in
which camp you're in, so where do you draw

42
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:58,055
inspirations from if you're focussing on
doing things or getting other people to do

43
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:03,070
things then you'll draw from disciplines
like marketing and economics. Disciplines

44
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,054
that are about measuring behavior and
thinking about craving structures that

45
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:12,818
encourage people to behave in certain
ways. On the other hand if you come from

46
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:16,972
the feelings aren't we going to look more
to the things like game design and

47
00:04:16,972 --> 00:04:21,634
cognitive psychology. These disciplines
that are about whats going on makes

48
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:26,455
someone interested in something, what is
there more deeply then. A surface

49
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:31,717
phenomenon that they're experiencing. And,
we've already talked about both of these

50
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:36,549
in the class, because the class is
designed to give you both perspectives and

51
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:41,320
show where they overlap. Similarly, if
you're thinking in the first cam p, you'll

52
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,704
talk about incentives, things that create
some mechanism to pull someone to an

53
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:51,506
activity. The other camp, you'll talk
about experiences. What the person

54
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:56,171
encounters, how they experience certain
activities again, the incentive is

55
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:02,606
something outside of them. The experience
is something inside them. The next one is

56
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:09,088
do we talk about satisfying people's
needs, people's desires, people's wants,

57
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:14,973
or do we talk about fun? That term that,
as we talked about, we can give meaning to

58
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:20,411
and we can think systematically about how
to design for fun, but it's something more

59
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:26,128
than just meeting basic needs or even
meeting higher level kinds of needs that

60
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:30,978
people have. There's something again
experiential and indivisible what this

61
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:36,396
notion of fun. If you are in the first
camp, you will gravitate more towards game

62
00:05:36,396 --> 00:05:41,649
elements, which are talked about in great
detail, and I say here inductive, in other

63
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:46,716
words, the idea is. Building up from the
bottom, little bits and pieces of games to

64
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:50,910
move towards the more integrated
experience. If you take the other

65
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,355
approach, you will start with game
thinking which is more deductive. Starting

66
00:05:55,355 --> 00:06:00,216
with general principals about how games
work and using those to go down to the

67
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:05,449
more specific examples. If you are in the
first camp you'll think more about status.

68
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,588
If you're in the second camp you'll think
more about meaning. And I've talked about

69
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:15,251
both of these in the psychological
section. The appeal of status but also

70
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:20,816
it's dangers. First camp is PBLs, points,
badges, leader boards. Second camp is

71
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:26,663
gamification as puzzles, as learning, as
challenges which can be represented in

72
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:31,672
systems involving game elements and
points, badges and leader boards but

73
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:36,388
typically involve a different kind of
approach. An approach that puts the

74
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:41,753
challenges and the puzzles and the
creativity at the center rather than the

75
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:47,645
structural or visible elements. Rewards on
the one hand, I've talked in great detail

76
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:51,784
about reward design. Especially in the
behaviorist tradition of psychology.

77
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:57,961
Progression, on the other hand. Mastery.
Competence. Not neces sarily about a

78
00:06:57,961 --> 00:07:03,946
reward. More about the journey. And
finally and in summary. The first camp is

79
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:09,622
about making users do things. The second
camp is about making players awesome.

80
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:15,721
Making users do things should mean making
them do things that they want to do on

81
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:21,295
their own. But, somehow don't get to.
There are things that are beneficial for

82
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:26,828
the player but the player needs some
motivational help. To push them along that

83
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:31,417
path. It doesn't mean, necessarily forcing
someone or tricking someone into doing

84
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:36,570
something that they never really wanted to
do in the first place. Making players

85
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:42,300
awesome is about figuring out in the first
instance. What it is that will help that

86
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,361
someone achieve their full potential and
focusing more on that, focusing on the

87
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:54,241
users goal than the external goals of some
organization or company [inaudible] those

88
00:07:54,241 --> 00:08:00,761
users. Now it should be evident by now.
That I tend to feel. Much more comfortable

89
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:07,528
with this camp here on the right with the
more game based approach to gamification.

90
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:13,142
But, I think it's important. And
essential, really to also understand the

91
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:18,215
one on the left. Many game designers tend
to be very dismissive or critical of

92
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:23,230
gamification. And we're going to look in
detail at some of those critiques later on

93
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:28,072
in the course. And I tend to think that
while their critiques do have some bite,

94
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:32,342
the notion that gamification is
fundamentally flawed. And looking for

95
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:37,438
example at game elements as opposed to
more integrative structures of game

96
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:42,472
thinking, is fundamentally misguided. I
tend to take issue with that because, as

97
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:47,239
we've seen, there are lots of great
examples of using the more doing based

98
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:52,623
approach to gamification to get to
valuable results for companies and for

99
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:58,364
users or players of the gamified system.
So, both perspectives tend to be valuable.

100
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:03,949
And, in a specific case, you may find one
or the other is more helpful. But it's

101
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:09,661
important to, as a starting point, be
aware of these two approaches and be aware

102
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:13,091
of where they come together and where they
diverge.
