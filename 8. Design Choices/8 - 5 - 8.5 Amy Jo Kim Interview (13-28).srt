1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,004
For this final segment on design, I wanted
you to hear from someone who actually

2
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:08,013
works in the field of game design
professionally.

3
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:12,036
Amy Jo Kim is an expert in the development
of social architectures.

4
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:17,021
In addition to her game design work, she's
also an author, and the organizer of

5
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:20,037
workshops on applied game design and
gamification.

6
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:25,060
As you'll see from my interview with her,
many of her ideas track the concepts that

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:32,018
I've been discussing in the course so far.
>> Amy Jo, thanks so much for joining us.

8
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:36,047
>> My pleasure.
>> You're one of the first people that I

9
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:42,007
came across talking about using game
design in other contexts, way before

10
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:47,082
anyone was using the term gamification.
So, I'm curious what you make of the

11
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:54,011
current gamification phenomenon, both how
people are describing it and what people

12
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:59,000
are actually doing.
>> A great question.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,653
So, to me it's a great wave of interest in
gaming that I think is happening because

14
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:11,260
of all the same reasons we see, you know,
how many people grew up with games, how

15
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,091
much the mechanics are now easier to use.
Some of them are getting standardized into

16
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:20,013
APIs and tool kits.
So, I see that there is tremendous

17
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,075
interest, and I love that interest.
I think the word gamification will end up

18
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:29,066
going away, and that this will be part of
the tool kit of many different types of

19
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:32,034
design in the similar way that AI went
away.

20
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:37,013
We don't think of Amazon as an AI system,
although it does have what used to be

21
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:42,005
called artificial intelligence in it with
its collaborative filtering mechanisms,

22
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:42,096
right?
>> Mm-hm.

23
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:46,077
>> Evolution, I think, will also happen
with gamification.

24
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:51,083
I think what we see right now is the
awakening of what will be a much bigger

25
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:56,095
and longer trend, and I don't think it
will be called gamification cuz I don't

26
00:01:56,095 --> 00:02:00,083
think it'll be one thing.
I think it will be many different

27
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:05,088
techniques that are inspired by games,
that get embedded in different ways in

28
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:09,082
software.
So short answer is, I think the word will

29
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:14,011
go away but.
The wave will only grow bigger and will

30
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:19,598
become an integral part of most software.
>> Well so let me ask you about something

31
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,237
specific that we hear a lot about in, in
gamification circles which is Richard

32
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:28,373
Bartle's notion of player types.
That, you know, pretty much every

33
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:32,891
presentation that, that I've heard on
gamification that goes into detail says

34
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:37,271
that, that the core issue is that there's
these, these different kinds of players

35
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:40,960
and we can design for them.
You actually I think have a, have a

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,742
slightly different perspective on that.
Can you talk about it?

37
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:48,249
>> Well I have a game designer's
perspective.

38
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:52,141
I know Richard Bartle.
I know where those come from.

39
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:57,825
And I also can, you know, repeat some of
what he said publicly which is, taking his

40
00:02:57,825 --> 00:03:01,812
structures and applying it to all
gamification is silly.

41
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:08,090
And the reason is the, that's a model of a
certain kind of emergent human behavior

42
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,282
that he saw as a pattern in a number of
MUDs, multi-user dimensions, which are the

43
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:20,604
text precursors to games like W.o.W.
So, that is very true and when I worked on

44
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:27,409
designing MMOs, I worked on Ultima Online,
I worked on Earth and Beyond, done Sims

45
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:30,648
Online.
Those were particularly useful player

46
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:32,690
types.
There are many systems.

47
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,623
There's the, you know, Myers Briggs
system.

48
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:41,725
That's another system for in-, there's all
kinds of systems to say here's how people

49
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:44,338
are.
Systems are for utility, but they never

50
00:03:44,338 --> 00:03:47,572
describe the be-all and end-all of all
human behavior.

51
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:53,158
So, if you're building an MMO or something
that has those dynamics, those four player

52
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,094
types are extremely useful, and I think
appropriate to use as a model.

53
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:03,560
You're working on something else, which is
what most of gamification is.

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,177
Then.
They actually don't work.

55
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:09,145
And the reason I know this is because I
have a consulting business and I've had,

56
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:13,354
you know, used player types with what,
maybe twenty maybe 30 different clients,

57
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:17,679
and what I've learned is that they only
work for a small segment of games.

58
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:21,575
A game like Structures.
I've developed a different take on player

59
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:26,319
types that is much more about what I see
in social media and social gaming, very

60
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,062
similar to Bartle, inspired by Bartle.
I always start by saying, there's Bartle's

61
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,090
player types.
Here's why they don't work for what we're

62
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,081
doing.
Here's how to tweak them to make them work

63
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:42,031
for what you're doing.
So here's Bartle's player types, and what

64
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:47,089
I've found and what he's said publicly is
that points, badges, levels, and

65
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:53,063
leaderboards which are the tropes of
gamification fundamentally appeal to

66
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:59,053
achievers which is a small segment.
And here's my take on Bartle's which I

67
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:05,030
call, which I structure around social
engagement verbs, because it's actually

68
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,025
easier to apply.
Very similarly, there's competing,

69
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:14,075
collaborating, exploring, and expressing.
Explore is right out of Bartle, so that

70
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:18,046
one is similar.
Competing is similar to the achievers, but

71
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:22,005
more specific.
Collaborating is very much what he calls

72
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:24,098
socializers, but with a very game
perspective.

73
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:30,026
And the reason is that if you're trying to
choose which game mechanics and which

74
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:35,059
strategy to adopt for your gamification.
Understanding this is extremely useful,

75
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:41,045
and then what Bartle didn't talk about at
all that is a huge driver in social media

76
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:45,050
and social gaming is self-expression.
That one was missing.

77
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:51,008
And the drive toward self-expression.
For many people, that's a primary player

78
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:54,023
type.
That there's people that will just play

79
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:59,088
with their avatars and their Miis on the
Wii and it's a very, very much a part of

80
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:05,047
how social games in particular monetize.
So these are the four words that I find

81
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:09,098
particularly useful.
And then here's very specific words, built

82
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:16,300
around those and one of the exercises that
I do with my clients is to map out the

83
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:24,190
core actions in their product against this
chart and see where they fall.

84
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:29,968
And then map that against who they're who
they're trying to reach.

85
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:33,604
For example, if you're trying to reach
females.

86
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:38,978
You always ask at the beginning who's
participating in this and how is it they

87
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:42,285
like to engage.
You're doing, if it's an all male

88
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:46,913
situation and let's say it's a bunch of
sales guys, they're gonna be really

89
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:50,612
compe-, really comfortable with friendly
and a competitive trope.

90
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:55,489
If it's females, predictably say middle
aged moms, or young moms, in general,

91
00:06:55,489 --> 00:07:00,347
they're gonna respond much better to
collaborative mechanics and social

92
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:03,522
mechanics.
And things like the leader board would be

93
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:06,729
not the first thing to do for that kind of
community.

94
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:11,472
What I encourage all my clients to do and
my students to do, is to take this and

95
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,695
don't be afraid to tweak it.
Take it as a starting point.

96
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:19,585
Take Bartle as a starting point, and then
say, okay, in the world I'm living in with

97
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:22,847
my product, what, you know, what describes
the prototypes?

98
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:26,392
There might actually be something that's
much more specific.

99
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:29,195
>> Mm-hm.
>> To what you're doing that is more

100
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:31,791
useful to you.
So, the sac-, don't hold the sacred cow so

101
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,832
sacred.
>> [laugh].

102
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:36,911
>> Would be my summary statement.
>> So, always, always good advice.

103
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:41,633
So, let me ask you to say a little bit
more about collaborative gaming, because

104
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:46,429
people often tend to assume that, that
competition is just inherently something

105
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:50,377
that's at the part of games.
So, what's the opportunities base around

106
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:53,794
those more collaborative and
self-expression types of games?

107
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:58,398
>> Here's a particular definition that's
taken from one of the earliest books on

108
00:07:58,398 --> 00:08:01,825
game design.
A game is a system where players engage in

109
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:06,476
an artificial conflict, by my rules,
resulting in a quantifiable outcome.

110
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:11,948
So that defines a whole host of games.
But not all games, and increasingly not

111
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:17,466
the games that in fact are being some of
the biggest hits in the gaming world.

112
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:21,110
So what that does define very well are
zero sum games.

113
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:27,047
And in game theories there are some games
are simply games where we are opponents,

114
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:31,277
where we competing for scarce resources,
if I win you lose.

115
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:36,599
You can layer a team dynamic on to that,
but that's fundamentally what a zero sum

116
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,163
game is.
Dynamics of.

117
00:08:38,163 --> 00:08:41,058
Head-to-head battles.
Any kind of battle.

118
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,563
Any war simulation.
Go, chess, polo, anything like that.

119
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:47,526
Any rank ordered competition, the
Olympics.

120
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:52,468
These are all zero-sum games.
Most gambling games are also zero-sum

121
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:55,649
games.
Though you're usually playing against the

122
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,614
house.
But again its a finite pie that needs to

123
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:04,465
be divided up among winners and losers.
So, the, what I've found and some of the

124
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:10,377
games I've worked on that I love the most.
I found that their, that definition wasn't

125
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:13,269
working.
I worked on The Sims and then The Sims

126
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:17,936
Online, worked on Ultima Online.
I worked on Rock Band, probably one of my

127
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:22,224
favorite all-time experiences.
Those games, you can't just, they don't

128
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:26,043
have, The Sims doesn't have a quantifiable
outcome, you just keep playing.

129
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:30,020
Neither does Ultima Online.
So I define those games as a structured

130
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,998
experience with rules and goals that's fun
to play, which to me is a good working

131
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:38,065
definition of a gamified system.
Rules and goals are pretty critical, fun

132
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:41,424
to play is pretty critical, or at least
pleasant, engaging.

133
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:47,209
And not a completely unstructured
experience, but I realized as I dug into

134
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:52,083
game theory that, that actually was
defining, sorry, non-zero sum games.

135
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:57,033
In non-zero sum games we are not
opponents, we're partners.

136
00:09:57,033 --> 00:10:00,046
And it's a win-win or possibly a lose-lose
situation.

137
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:04,071
Trading is a non-zero-sum game.
Draw Something is a perfect example of a

138
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:08,020
non-zero-sum game because you either both
lose or both win.

139
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:12,032
So other examples would be mini playground
games, party games.

140
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:16,070
I just mentioned Draw Something which is
Pictionary in a mobile device.

141
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:21,026
Martial arts are about personal
advancement and achievement but with a

142
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:25,088
very supportive your winning doesn't make
somebody else lose unless it's a

143
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:29,046
head-to-head competition.
The general martial arts is very

144
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:33,003
non-zero-sum.
And one of the best examples is a charity

145
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:37,022
walk where the more people you can join up
the more money you raise.

146
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:41,035
We're all winning together.
How many people can we bring in here to

147
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:44,064
win together?
That's really what non-zero sum gaming is

148
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:48,001
about, and to me that's the heart of
collaborative gaming.

149
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:55,048
Since you have experience both, on the web
side and in the, the games world, I'm

150
00:10:55,048 --> 00:11:01,051
curious, if you feel like there is a
particular mistake that people make when

151
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:06,870
they come out of web design, and social
media, and those kinds of worlds, and try

152
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,045
to engage in gamification?
That's a great question.

153
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:17,028
The thing I see the most and I just saw
this last week when I did an audit for a

154
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:19,037
start up.
See it all the time.

155
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:24,005
People in the web world are very good at
understanding funnels and engagement

156
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:25,062
loops.
That's very natural.

157
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:30,049
That's familiar to a lot of what they do.
They also are familiar with loyalty and

158
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:34,091
the basic concepts of loyalty.
What they are not familiar with is the

159
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:40,049
fact that a gaming experience changes over
time, and that there are key stages of a

160
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:45,318
players life cycle what you call the
player journey, that require actually a

161
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:50,049
different set of features and a different
set of powers to give the person.

162
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:55,046
So the idea that you're creating an
experience that unfolds over time and

163
00:11:55,046 --> 00:12:00,042
changes over time in response to someone's
increasing commitment and skill.

164
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:04,049
Is fundamental to a good game, especially
a good computer game.

165
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:07,006
And that's the mistake I see people
seeing.

166
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:11,079
They say look, we've got the funnel, and
we've got this habit loop built, and now

167
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,014
we will drive habits.
Well, you will for a little while.

168
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:20,021
And guess what, if you throw a bunch of
points at people you'll get a short term

169
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,055
lift.
I have no doubt.

170
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:25,023
And you'll see some nice metrics, but it's
not sustainable.

171
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:30,062
The thing that makes it sustainable is for
the experience itself to evolve over time.

172
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:35,076
So I use the three stages of newbie,
regular, and expert as an analytic tool to

173
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:41,009
help you really think about, you know, the
first day or week all of which is a newbie

174
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,075
experience, not just that very first
visit.

175
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:47,073
And then the 2-month-in when someone has
actually become a regular.

176
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:51,034
And then the expert, what we in gaming
call the elder game.

177
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:55,037
What is it that the most dedicated and
skillful two to five percent of your

178
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:57,321
players can do that everybody else can't
do?

179
00:12:57,321 --> 00:13:01,685
What is it that keeps them hooked?
It's not the same thing as in an earlier

180
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:04,559
stage.
So really thinking about that life cycle

181
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,150
and thinking about your engagement loops
at every stage of your life cycle, not

182
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,733
just at that very first stage, will
dramatically impact your ability to drive

183
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:17,102
retention and profit.
>> Now that's, that's very good advice

184
00:13:17,102 --> 00:13:20,967
and, and of course I think well, what
we're all looking for is ways to make this

185
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,581
sustainable and engaging.
So, very much appreciate you sharing your

186
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:27,014
insights with the class.
Thanks for joining us.

187
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,077
>> Thanks for having me.
