1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,069
How do you decide if gamification is right
for your organization or the business

2
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:12,088
problem or other kind of challenge that
you have to address? There are four

3
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:18,092
questions to ask to determine if
gamification is a good approach to take.

4
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:25,024
And these are, first of all, motivation.
Gamification is about motivation so you

5
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:31,033
need to first say, would you derive value
from encouraging certain behavior if

6
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:36,096
motivation matters to the business
problem, it's likely the gamification

7
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,657
would be a good approach. Second is
meaningful choices. Are the tasks involved

8
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:48,116
potentially, sufficiently interesting?
Meaningful choices is one definition of

9
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:53,803
the very nature of games. And it's
implicit in many aspects of the intrinsic

10
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:59,358
motivation description that I gave you
under self-determination theory. The

11
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:05,437
notion of competence and autonomy is
basically the same as saying the user has

12
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:12,036
to feel like there are choices and those
choices are meaningful. Third is

13
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:19,047
structure. And this basically says, can we
effectively gamify the system by using

14
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:26,582
rules or algorithms? So, is this a problem
that will lend itself to a digital system,

15
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:32,906
which is what gamification typically is,
that encodes the basic rules for this

16
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:39,093
problem set? If it's not, if it's
something that's too vague or too

17
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:45,059
subjective or where the rules or the
objectives aren't sufficiently clear, then

18
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:51,018
gamification may not work even if this is
a problem that would benefit from

19
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:56,026
motivation and that's sufficiently
interesting. And finally, potential

20
00:01:56,026 --> 00:02:01,077
conflicts. What other motivational
structures are there in the organization?

21
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:06,724
And, will the gamified system potentially
come into tension with them? So, let's

22
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:12,301
look at all four of those questions in a
little bit more detail. The first is

23
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:18,740
motivation. So, what are the situations
where motivation is important? Typically

24
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:25,585
two broad categories which is you see are
very different. The first is situations

25
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:33,037
that involve real deep creativity or
situations that involve unique skills and

26
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:40,005
connections and teamwork. Situations where
it's not just rote work. It's not

27
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:45,622
necessaril y something simple and
familiar. It's something complex and deep

28
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:51,653
that requires people to go the extra mile.
And motivation is the secret ingredient

29
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:57,484
that gets them to do that. So, these are
the high value add kinds of tasks, the

30
00:02:57,484 --> 00:03:03,052
desire for innovation, the desire for more
productivity, the desire for lasting

31
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:09,025
consumer engagement. The things that
require more than just a simple push of

32
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:15,031
the button. The second broad category
where motivation is valuable, though, is

33
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:21,026
exactly that kind of situation. The
situation where the task at hand seems

34
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:27,033
very dull, boring, and repetitive. Because
those are the kinds of task where, if you

35
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:33,038
can find some motivation, if you can find
some meaning and some interest level in

36
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:38,982
the task and some challenge that motivates
people, the impact is quite significant

37
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:44,797
because without those things, there's no
way except for the external, extrinsic

38
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:50,931
kinds of approaches to get people involved
in the task. And a wonderful example comes

39
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:56,953
from the book Reamde, a recent science
fiction book by Neal Stephenson. If you

40
00:03:56,953 --> 00:04:02,625
haven't read it, I'd encourage you to read
the first 200 pages, they're great. The

41
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:08,211
next 800 pages, not so good. But it's a
delightful book, like many of his books,

42
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:14,068
in terms of getting us to think about a
potential future that in many ways is

43
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:19,362
already here. And the example for
gamification is that one of the characters

44
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:24,468
in the game, excuse me, in the book, is
the CEO of a massively multiplayer online

45
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:30,490
games company vaguely like the company
that makes World of Warcraft. Only, the

46
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,552
business model for this game is using
gamification. Specifically the game

47
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:41,983
applies itself generates revenue by going
to organizations that have dull tasks. The

48
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:47,943
first example that they give is airports
dealing with security and having people

49
00:04:47,943 --> 00:04:54,079
having to sit there and insure that no one
walks in the wrong way through the door

50
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,635
that goes to the baggage claim area.
Because there has to be an opening going

51
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:04,379
through there. And so therefore, you have
to check to make sure people aren't coming

52
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,746
through the wro ng way because they don't
go through security. And so, someone has

53
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:12,709
to sit there, but it's the most boring
thing in the world, to have to watch

54
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:16,739
person after person after person go out
the door on the off chance that some idiot

55
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:20,963
will wander in the other way by accident.
Much more likely to be that idiot than an

56
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:25,242
actual terrorist, but if that idiot gets
through because the person sitting at the

57
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:29,128
door fell asleep or wasn't paying
attention in their mind numbingly boring

58
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:33,002
task, then we've had lots of examples
where whole terminals have to get shut

59
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:37,187
down because someone is in the terminal
without having to gone through security

60
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:41,759
screening. So, the idea in Reamde, is that
this company comes up with the great idea.

61
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,269
They will use 3D motion capture to
represent the people walking through the

62
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,325
passage way in the terminal as creatures
in the game. So now, there's a castle in

63
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:56,518
the game and the people are walking down a
certain passage way in the castle, all in

64
00:05:56,518 --> 00:06:01,159
one direction. But the game says, in the
game, that there is a goblin trying to

65
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:06,153
sneak in. And if you catch the goblin
trying to sneak in, you get a big reward,

66
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:11,690
lots of experience points for you in the
game. And the result is lots of players of

67
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,275
the game sit there and try to catch the
goblin. They try to find the goblin even

68
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:22,078
though it involves the same thing that the
security guard had to do at the airport,

69
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:26,487
sitting and watching person after person
going through the right way in the hope

70
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:31,670
that you might find someone going through
the wrong way. Putting it into the game

71
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,752
suddenly makes that fun and engaging for
people. And in the book, this becomes a

72
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:41,529
huge business opportunity for this company
because they're able to leverage the

73
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:46,468
engagement of the game players to do tasks
that otherwise would be deadly boring. So,

74
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:51,427
that's an example of one kind of task that
might lend itself to gamified motivation

75
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:56,127
that's very different from the kinds of
tasks that we might at first think of.

76
00:06:56,127 --> 00:07:01,102
Second question to decide whether
gamification is right for you is whether

77
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:06,266
it involves meaningful choic es. And here,
we can think about a number of different

78
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:11,954
kinds of situations that we talked about
that make choices meaningful. Are there

79
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:17,334
options for the user? Do they connect up
with things that are meaningful for the

80
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:23,260
user? Does the gamified system do things
in a way that seem interesting where the

81
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,044
user has to make choices, that they care
about the outcome? But there are many

82
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:33,278
gamified systems out there today, that
don't seem to focus on this as much.

83
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:38,808
Here's one example here which is Google
News Badges which I believe I've already

84
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:43,976
mention. And Google News Badges gives you
badges just for reading stories on a

85
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:48,417
particular area. There's no choice
involved except for the choice of what

86
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:52,728
stories you're reading. But that's not
really a meaningful choice. Here you see

87
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:57,593
that this person started reading stories
about Syria and it says keep reading about

88
00:07:57,593 --> 00:08:02,058
Syria and you'll earn a bronze badge. But
the question is, what's meaningful about

89
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:06,050
that? If you read a little bit about
Syria, do you want to start reading much

90
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,687
more about Syria to become an expert on
Syria? Or, do you want to read some about

91
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:15,167
Syria and then go read something about the
Olympics, or some other topic because

92
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:19,886
that's what a news site or a newspaper
does, it lets you find out about many

93
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:24,822
different things, as opposed to one thing
to the exclusion of all others. That's not

94
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:28,939
really a meaningful choice, deciding to
write, to read a few more articles about

95
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:33,279
something just because you're going to get
a badge. So, I don't wanna cast

96
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,710
dispersions at Google News badges. I'm not
sure what the design criteria were for it

97
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:43,345
and what it's trying to accomplish but
from a perspective of thinking about

98
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:47,817
whether this is a situation where
gamification is a logical or natural

99
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:53,242
solution, not so clear. Third one is
structure. Is about can we use rules,

100
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:59,453
algorithms, hard-edged decisions to
implement a gamified system. And so, here

101
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:06,766
is the Samsung Nation site that I referred
to a number of times. And you can see the

102
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:13,089
points in the leader boards, but the
question is un derlying that. What does it

103
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:18,647
take to get the points? What things are
worth more? So, two of the tasks that Sam

104
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:23,692
Sung Nation let's you address are sharing
things on Twitter, tweeting about

105
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:29,019
something you've done on the site or
registering your product that you bought,

106
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:34,052
your Samsung product that you bought in a
real store, do you go on the site and

107
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:39,396
register it? Samsung Nation gives you 500
points for registering the product and a

108
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:44,367
100 points for tweeting about something
that you did on the site. Now, I don't

109
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:48,818
know again from Samsung's business
criteria, why they picked one or the

110
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:53,752
other. But the point is a system that lets
you make those choices in trade-offs in a

111
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:58,459
coherent way, tends to be one that will
lends itself well towards gamification

112
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,828
because you can build in these different
kinds of motivators and then think about

113
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:08,664
different ways to encourage people to
chose between them and to make their own

114
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:13,647
trade-off as to what's more meaningful to
them. Again, this ties back in to the

115
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:18,888
notion of meaningful choices. The points
are just guides and people in playing need

116
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:24,574
to decide, how they personally value the
activity, vis-a-vis what the point system

117
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:29,473
is telling them. And finally, conflicts.
What other motivational structures are

118
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:34,253
there out there? So, this is particularly
important, say, in a company, there is a

119
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:39,160
motivational structure for employees. It's
called their salary. It's called their

120
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,431
desire not to get fired from their job.
That's not necessarily in conflict with

121
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:47,901
some system that says go do this because
it's fun and because it's going to

122
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:52,511
motivate you to be part of a community to
have some achievement or accomplishment.

123
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:57,476
But, there might be some tension if those
things pull in opposite directions or if

124
00:10:57,476 --> 00:11:01,643
the user starts to wonder, well, should I
be doing this for the salary or should I

125
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:06,788
be doing this for the fun, what's the
trade off between the two? Another context

126
00:11:06,788 --> 00:11:11,909
for illustrative purposes where this comes
up a lot is, school. So, we have all kinds

127
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:17,086
of motivators in school, including very
extrinsic ones, as well as increasingly

128
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:22,084
intrinsic ones trying to get students to
authentically care about and enjoy

129
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:27,075
learning. So , when gamification gets
applied to learning, it's very important

130
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:32,047
to try to understand the potential
conflicts. So, this here is a gamified

131
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:37,084
leader board or gamified experience point
system that was developed by Lee Sheldon

132
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:43,012
who's a professor at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, he teaches game

133
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:49,048
design, and he gamified his courses. And
this was the system that he used for

134
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:55,367
giving students points instead of saying,
you get an A+ for a perfect score, and

135
00:11:55,367 --> 00:12:01,338
then it goes down from there A, B, C, D, F
and the idea being you start at a 100

136
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:06,086
percent and every mistake you get, you go
down till you settle on your final grade.

137
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:12,050
What Sheldon realized was that games don't
work that way, games work by building up,

138
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,087
you start at zero experience points and
grow and grow and grow until you reach

139
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:23,018
your final level. So, he said, why don't
we do school like this, why don't we say

140
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:28,024
you start here at zero, you start with an
F? And based on what you do, based on

141
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:33,039
every assignment that you turn in, every
achievement you get within the course, you

142
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,080
move up and up and up until you ultimately
settle at your final level and that's your

143
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,032
grade. Very cool idea. Very powerful if
designed right. But, it needs to be

144
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:48,023
designed consciously around the existing
sets of incentives. So, if this system

145
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:52,075
were done in parallel to traditional
grading, that would cause some real

146
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:57,078
tension and some real dissonance for the
students. In Sheldon's class, as he uses

147
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:02,058
this as the entire grading structure. But
even so, it needs to be designed in an

148
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:07,013
effective way that doesn't create
conflicts between different other kinds of

149
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:11,091
motivations that students might have. So,
that's an example to illustrate the need

150
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:16,047
to think about different tensions that
might occur among different motivators. If

151
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:21,006
you think about all four of these
questions systematically and come up with

152
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:25,055
good answers for them, you can be fairly
confident that gamification is a

153
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:30,035
worthwhile approach to use to tackle a par
ticular business or other challenge.
