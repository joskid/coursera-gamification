1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,023
There's a lot to learn from behaviorism.
Certainly the notion that we should be

2
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:09,098
scientific and systematic and not just
rely on people's reporting of their

3
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:14,079
feelings is a worthwhile endeavor. And
some of the concepts that behaviorism

4
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:19,341
focuses on, for example the importance of
feedback. The idea that feedback loops can

5
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:24,864
systematically modify people's behavior is
an important finding and one that's quite

6
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:29,531
relevant to gamification. And the
different kinds of rewards that we talked

7
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:34,767
about can help us see how to construct
different kinds of systems to motivate

8
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:40,006
behavior. But, there are serious
limitations and blind spots to the

9
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:45,090
behaviorist approach. And we need to
understand them in order to have a full

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,017
picture of gamification. For starters,
there are some important things that

11
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:56,064
behaviorism leaves out. Let's go back to
the speed camera lottery example. Why do

12
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,260
people slow down when there is this sign
that shows them how fast they're going and

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,065
the possibility of winning some money if
they're not speeding. Well, the first

14
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:12,085
thing to think about is that people slow
down, even without the lottery. When

15
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:18,026
there's just a sign showing people how
fast they're going, there seems to be an

16
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:23,063
effect that people slow down even then. So
how do we explain that? Well some of it

17
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:28,072
has to do with feedback, clearly. People
are seeing their speed. It's making them

18
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:34,000
aware of how fast they're going, which is
then creating a reaction and causing the

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,035
person to slow down. But is it just that
the person's becoming aware that they were

20
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:44,044
speeding or is, what's going on something
like this. The driver says hm, is this

21
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:49,096
just a sign or is there perhaps a camera
in it somewhere hidden here that's going

22
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:55,058
to take a picture of me and I'm going to
get sent a ticket automatically because I

23
00:01:55,058 --> 00:02:00,301
was speeding? Or perhaps is there a cop?
Right behind the sign who is going to give

24
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:04,284
me a ticket if I go too fast? In which
case I am slowing down not because of

25
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:09,014
feedback so much, I am slowing down
because I want to avoid the punishment.

26
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:13,376
Punishments are just the flip side of
rewards. They work the same way so at some

27
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:18,038
level, this is the kind of standard
behavioristic account, but it's very much

28
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:22,704
cause and effect. We want to avoid direct
the punishment, so we take some action.

29
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:26,646
It's not about people changing their
behavior and learning, it's just people

30
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:31,641
slowing down because they think they are
going get caught. So what about now, the

31
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:36,124
speed camera lottery example? What does
the lottery change? Well, from a

32
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:41,231
behaviorist's standpoint, at first it's
hard to think about it. But if you look at

33
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:46,546
this through that kind of behavioral lens.
What you say is well, behaviorism is about

34
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:51,040
testing what people do. And what's
different here is a chance of winning

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,157
money and turns out that people love
lotteries. There's some reason why there

36
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:59,349
are lotteries all over the place and
people will spend their money on them even

37
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:04,094
when the odds are terrible. When you know
empirically, statistically, you're very

38
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:08,983
likely to lose. Not a good bet to make,
people still play the lottery all the time

39
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:14,033
so a behaviorist might say, alright.
People love lotteries. That's a lesson.

40
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:20,059
That's a fact that we know. So this works.
Because it's a lottery and that's all we

41
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:24,840
need to know. So let's do lotteries in
lots of other places and this was in fact

42
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,563
the description of the speed camera
lottery from Richard Thaler, one of the

43
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:35,065
leading figures in behavioral economics,
in an op-ed piece that he wrote about this

44
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:40,066
phenomenon. And basically, his conclusion
was policy makers should use lotteries.

45
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:45,740
And maybe that's a helpful conclusion but
the point I want to make is, it leaves a

46
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,507
lot out. Why do people like lotteries? Is
it just that we're irrational? What's

47
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:56,470
actually going on there? What is it about
the lottery here that is motivating to

48
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,482
people? And to answer that question you
have to go beyond behaviorism, because now

49
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:06,799
we're not just talking about what do
people do, now we're going to, what do

50
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,913
people think and feel? And what is
actually in there motivating someone to

51
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:17,975
act in a certain way? So, that's part of
the story that's important in general, and

52
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:25,054
in particular, important for gamification.
So, first big issue with behaviorism is it

53
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:30,296
leaves out alot. But there's some other
reasons to be concerned, about a purely

54
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:35,155
behaviorist approach. And as it turns out
B.F. Skinner's work on operating

55
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:40,442
conditioning fell out of favor in
psychology. There's still been a great

56
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:46,214
deal of work done in that area and much of
the literature on feedback. And today the

57
00:04:46,214 --> 00:04:51,565
work in the quantified self area can be
seen as being part of that same tradition.

58
00:04:51,565 --> 00:04:59,951
But the notion of modifying peoples
behavior thru these constructed systems of

59
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:07,063
reward or punishment based on learning
from feedback scared people. And they got

60
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:13,072
associated with things like socialism and
fascism that were trying to manipulate and

61
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:19,025
change people's behavior in ways that
people didn't want. Now, that's probably

62
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:24,070
not entirely fair but in thinking about
the implications of behaviorism for

63
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:30,051
gamification it's worth keeping in mind
because if you take a purely behaviorist

64
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:36,025
approach you tend to focus on the person
involved again, as a black box. And that

65
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:41,056
tends to move away from the notion that
this is a human being and this is a

66
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:46,037
player. Remember game thinking is about
empowering the person as a player. They

67
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:51,019
are the center of the action. So this
focus on rewards and behaviorism. Well,

68
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:56,067
again, it can be useful and productive in
the ways that we've talked about, tends to

69
00:05:56,067 --> 00:06:02,010
also have some problems. And in fact there
are a number of serious problems with a

70
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,043
behaviorist approach which we'll turn to
next.
