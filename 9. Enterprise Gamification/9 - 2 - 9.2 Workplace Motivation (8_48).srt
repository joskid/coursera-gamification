1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,027
An important question for enterprise
gamification is, what actually motivates

2
00:00:06,027 --> 00:00:12,062
people in the workplace? So, there are all
of the standard kinds of things. Your

3
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:18,082
salary, bonuses, stock options, verbal
praise from your supervisors, promotions,

4
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:23,095
more job responsibility. All the
traditional kinds of levers of

5
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:30,015
compensation that get used in the
workplace to encourage people to work. But

6
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:37,029
hopefully, if you've been listening to the
course so far, you realized that these are

7
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:43,850
almost entirely extrinsic motivators. They
are not things that are about the inherant

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:50,688
joy and pleasure and engagement of the
work. They are external rewards that are

9
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,440
designed as compensation. Think about what
the word compensation means. It's

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,004
something you'll have to get to compensate
you. Before doing something that you don't

11
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:08,462
really want to do, i.e. Work. So, there is
nothing wrong with that, of course, that's

12
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:14,383
how salaries work everywhere and they're
going to be the core element of how

13
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:20,603
people, get motivated to do jobs for most
people, but there's more to the story than

14
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:26,359
that. There's something beyond working for
external rewards, and that's where

15
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,602
gamification has a real opportunity if
it's designed in the ways I've talked

16
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:37,265
about to focus on producing engaging
experience and at activating intrinsic

17
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:43,137
motivation. So, let's look at a few
different ways that gamification can

18
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:49,677
motivate people at work outside of chasing
rewards. One Is learning, or skill

19
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:55,635
development. That might be in order to
obtain some of those extrinsic rewards. If

20
00:01:55,635 --> 00:02:01,007
you had better skills you get a higher
salary or you get promoted to a better job

21
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:06,706
or maybe you get a better job somewhere
else. But learning as I've talked about is

22
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:12,099
also about problem solving and it's about
engaging those parts of your brain that

23
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:17,205
love to figure out new things. So, skill
development in the workplace can take

24
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:22,673
advantage of gamification in a way that is
helpful for the employees and also

25
00:02:22,673 --> 00:02:27,106
beneficial for the companies. What I've
highlighted here is a screenshot from a

26
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:31,615
service by Live Ops, which is an
out-source cal l center operator. What

27
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:37,430
Live Ops does is they essentially create
virtual call centers by stitching together

28
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,362
people working at home using an
application to act as though they're part

29
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:47,541
of a virtual part of a call center. And so
Live Ops has lots of people working

30
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:52,503
part-time for them. Stay at home moms.
People who are out of work. People who

31
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:56,777
pick up an hour here, an hour there.
Answering calls or making outbound calls

32
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:02,108
for the call center from home and
therefore people who are often eager to

33
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:07,796
develop new skills if it can be done in a
flexible way that fits in with their

34
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:13,427
situation. So Live Ops has built their own
gamified site. It's got the usual kinds of

35
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:19,383
trophies and badges, it's got the feedback
metrics about what people are doing,

36
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:24,317
points, all of the usual things, but it's
very much geared towards skill

37
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:29,122
development. It's geared not as much
towards, we want you to get off this call

38
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:33,768
that you're on with a customer quickly and
in a way that makes the customer happy

39
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:38,475
which was the other call center example I
talked to you about. This is much more

40
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:43,481
about we want to help you learn how to be
better at this job. How to learn different

41
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:48,535
aspects of the job and how to be effective
in a way that will then move you up, in a

42
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:53,076
way that's recognized by the badges and
achievements and so forth, and then

43
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:59,100
potentially help you on the path to your
success in your career. So, that's one

44
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:06,594
motivator that lots of companies, have for
their employees, the opportunity to learn

45
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:13,010
things and skill up. Next is information.
So, what's the value of information to an

46
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,479
employee? Well, employees don't always
know how they're doing. Performance review

47
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,503
every six months, every year, and that's
very far removed from the day to day

48
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:27,416
process of your work. You get feedback
from your coworkers, and your boss and so

49
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:32,463
forth, but many employees don't really
have any sense about the quality of their

50
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:36,935
work and certainly no ability to directly
turn that back around and take advantage

51
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:42,081
of situations where they are doing a good
job. This is a screenshot fr om a company

52
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:47,067
called Objective Logistics which does
gamification, initially targeted at the

53
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:52,078
restaurant industry. So, they provide a
dashboard for restaurants to use for their

54
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:57,414
servers where they can track how the
servers are doing. What tip, what check

55
00:04:57,414 --> 00:05:02,075
size they're getting and what their
performance is. And they can then provide

56
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:07,898
feedback to the employees about how
they're doing in this weeks challenge is

57
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:13,635
sell a bunch of the dinner entrees and so
forth. There are various metrics that are

58
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:18,881
put on here. There's summaries about your
ranking on the leaderboard, and how much

59
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:23,976
you earned in extra tips. All of this
provides information to the server and it

60
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:28,561
provides information to the company and
the company can use this in order to

61
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:33,610
target the best shifts to the employees
who are doing the best job which motivates

62
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,591
the employees to do a better job to get
the better work opportunities and also

63
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:43,627
gives them a much more concrete sense of
what their performance is. It activates

64
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:48,387
the competitive instinct and the desire to
chase the reward but it also paints a

65
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:53,581
better picture for the employee, connects
up very directly what they are doing via

66
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:58,834
feedback to the way that the company
treats them. The next one is corporate

67
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:04,182
citizenship. So, this I'll talk about in
more detail in a subsequent segment. But

68
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:09,533
there are things that you do sometimes in
a company that are not necessarily about

69
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:14,887
your job. Great example is the language
quality game from Microsoft that I used as

70
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:19,543
one of the early examples where they got
employees to review all of these dialogue

71
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:24,223
boxes for Windows localization in
different languages. And I told you that

72
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:29,300
thousands of Microsoft employees did this
voluntarily. Why? Well part of it was just

73
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,090
the inherent fun of the game, part of it
was competition to want to beat the other

74
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:39,045
offices. But part of it was a sense that
they were doing something that was good

75
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:43,082
for the company. They were helping
Microsoft make better products by removing

76
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:48,034
bugs and errors in the localization of
windows. And that's something that peop le

77
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:52,096
who are part of an organization, part of a
team, feel some resonance with. They are

78
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:57,062
not going to work as a volunteer for weeks
on end just for the company's good but

79
00:06:57,062 --> 00:07:02,022
they want to take pride in their work and
their workplace and they want to be good

80
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:06,048
corporate citizens. So, that's a motivator
that can be used for gamification.

81
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:12,021
Finally, last but certainly not least.
What about fun? What's the role of fun in

82
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:16,096
the workplace? Well there're lots of
benefits of fun in the workplace. Creating

83
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:21,068
a more congenial environment, promoting
teamwork, so on, and so forth. But there

84
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:27,000
are opportunities to specifically use fun
to achieve direct workplace benefits. This

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,075
is something called the Face Game at
Zappos. And if you want to see more

86
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:36,075
details there's a little video here about
this. Zappos is an online retailer

87
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:41,025
initially of shoes and now of other
clothing-type items that's part of

88
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:46,006
amazon.com now Amazon bought it for
roughly a billion dollars. And Zappos, as

89
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:51,038
we'll talk about, is a very fun workplace.
This is something that they created called

90
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,026
the Face Game for their employees. When
you log onto the company Internet, after

91
00:07:56,026 --> 00:08:01,371
you type in your name and password, you
get shown a picture of someone who's one

92
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:07,221
of your coworkers randomly selected. And
you get to say, "Who is this?" And you can

93
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:11,602
fill in this is Ronda", or you can say "I
have no clue, don't know who this is". And

94
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:15,629
what the game does is once you do that,
either says "congratulations you got it

95
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,440
right, it is Ronda", or it says "Nope.
That was actually Brenda" and we'll give

96
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,471
you Brenda's profile page in the company
internet. So, what this does is creates a

97
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:32,032
little bit of fun and helps people get to
know their coworkers, helps them find out

98
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:37,435
more about the people who work with, with
them, what they do, where they work, what

99
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:42,539
their skills are which can be valuable in
terms of promoting better collaboration

100
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:48,000
and teamwork within the organization. All
based on leveraging off of fun.
