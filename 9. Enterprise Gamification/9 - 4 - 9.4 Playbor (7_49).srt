00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,062
An important question that arises in
enterprise gamification is whether the

2
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:13,309
game is truly voluntary. And one way to
describe that is the word Playbor which is

3
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:20,057
the combination of play and labor. If
it's, both play and work at the same time,

4
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:26,026
what is it? Is it a game? Well, under the
definition of games that I gave you, it's

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:31,659
not. A game has to be voluntary. That's at
the essence of what makes something game

6
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:37,060
like the fact that you choose to play and
you choose to take the rules of the game

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,988
seriously. If someone says, go play this
game right now, then you don't necessarily

8
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:49,055
have a choice. If you're forced to do it,
you may be going through the same motions.

9
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:54,058
If, let's say, you're an actor hired to
play a game of soccer in a movie, you're

10
00:00:54,058 --> 00:01:00,065
not playing soccer when you're acting out
your role, you're acting out your role.

11
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:05,802
So, what about someone who is forced to
play a game at work, or more commonly, is

12
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:11,283
forced to engage in some gamified activity
at work? What if they don't have agency

13
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:17,097
and choice over the matter but their
employer puts into place a gamified system

14
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:23,528
to incentivize them to work harder and be
more productive? What about, for example,

15
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:29,710
these checkout cashiers at Target who have
the screen here that you see in front of

16
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:36,645
you when they are checking people out at
the store. The screen has a system that

17
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:43,620
gives you either green, red or yellow
based on how fast you check someone out.

18
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,105
So this person that just got checked out,
they got a G. They did well, they did that

19
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:55,952
fast enough. You see your last ten scores,
you see your total scores. This person has

20
00:01:55,952 --> 00:02:02,083
88 percent G and other information. Now,
you can look at that and say great. That's

21
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:07,703
incentivizing those target check out
clerks to do a better job. It's making it

22
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:13,306
a little bit more fun for them. It's
giving them some extra added incentive to

23
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:19,591
do a better performance on their task. Or
you can look at it and say, wait a minute.

24
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:24,615
First of all, this is not about the
cashiers at all. It's about the company

25
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:30,571
monitoring them down to the level of every
individual checkout. So it's this kind of

26
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:36,573
private big brother looking over your
shoulder constantly every second as you're

27
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:42,130
at work. And secondly, it's not at all
about fun or about voluntariness Or about,

28
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,679
meaning or anything for the employee. It's
purely about, external extrinsic controls.

29
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:53,694
It's purely about, we will reward you if
you do well or maybe even more so, we will

30
00:02:53,694 --> 00:03:00,109
punish you if you don't do as well. And
where's the play, where's the game aspect

31
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:06,241
in that? So, there's a real question here.
At the conceptual level about whether

32
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:11,271
these are gameification. But more, more
importantly at the practical level, are

33
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:17,173
these a good idea? And are these mandatory
systems truly fair and appropriate and

34
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:23,031
ethical for the workers? Here's another
example to take a look at. This is an

35
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:29,125
article from the Los Angeles Times. If you
want to read the actual article you can

36
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:34,651
get it here. It's a story about a group of
laundry workers and housekeeping staff at

37
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:40,097
hotels at Disneyland. And Disney has put
into place at these hotels a leader board

38
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:46,068
system. So, as they are doing the laundry
in the basement of these hotel, they see

39
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:51,083
how quickly every member of the
housekeeping staff is cleaning rooms, and

40
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:57,081
performing their other assigned duties and
there's a leader board and a ranking that

41
00:03:57,081 --> 00:04:03,062
shows them in that way. And the employees
have a name for this system. They don't

42
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:09,068
call it a game, they don't call it a
leader board, they call it the Electronic

43
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:16,068
Whip. It's something that they perceive as
standing over them, threatening them with

44
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:22,046
punishment and goading them on to work
harder. Here's a couple of quotes from the

45
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:26,861
story to get you thinking about whether
this is the kind of practice that should

46
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:31,459
be encouraged or potentially if it's the
kind of practice that necessarily will

47
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:36,296
follow as gamification takes hold in the
enterprise. Here is a quote from one of

48
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:41,674
the workers saying, I was nervous and felt
I was being controlled even more. So, this

49
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:46,573
ties in very directly to what I talked
about with regard to self determination

50
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:50,781
theory. Part of what makes something intri
nsically motivating is when the person

51
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:56,071
feels autonomy. They feel like they are in
control of the situation. If the feedback

52
00:04:56,071 --> 00:05:00,077
that they get doesn't promote that, that
autonomy. If it's not purely

53
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:05,025
informational, but it's perceived as
controlling, it's feedback saying, we are

54
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:10,015
using this to tell you what to do and to
make you do what we want, then it does not

55
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,069
promote intrinsic motivation. And then,
actually, it can demotivate. It can lead

56
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:19,035
to worse performance. Here's a couple more
quotes. What were the effects of this

57
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:23,084
electronic whip system according to the
workers? Well, it led to a sort of

58
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:28,010
competition. Great, competition. The
workers see the leader-board, and without

59
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,072
being told anything more, they figure out
that this is a game, and they try to play

60
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:37,029
the game, and try to score high. And some
of the workers tried to race to the head

61
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:41,057
of the pack. So you might think, okay,
great, this is working the way it should,

62
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:47,012
but here's the kicker. That lead to
dissension and made other employees worry

63
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:52,031
that a reasonable pace wouldn't be enough
to keep the boss happy. Is that really

64
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:57,024
what we want? Is that really even in the
interest of the company in terms of

65
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:02,029
promoting a successful and effective
workforce. And final quote here, according

66
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:07,048
to some of the workers, employees have
been known to skip bathroom breaks, out of

67
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:12,073
fear that their production will fall and
managers will demand an explanation. All

68
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:18,087
of this just from a leader board. So, it's
important to think about, first of all,

69
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:24,081
how can gamified systems in the enterprise
be designed to promote the beneficial

70
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:30,032
aspects of gamification but not lead to
this kind of lord of the flies, all

71
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:36,035
against all competition that demoralizes
workers and likely based on the research

72
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:42,037
about intrinsic motivation, likely will
lead to worse performance than they had

73
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:48,019
before. How do companies avoid that and
still get the benefits that we've talked

74
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:53,096
about from gamification in the enterprise?
One aspect is the extent to which the

75
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:59,005
system is voluntary. And is perceived as
voluntary by the workers, and is perceived

76
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:03,057
as transparent. What is this doing? Is
this actually tracking me for something

77
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:07,045
that will be used in assessing my job
performance? Or is this just

78
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:11,095
informational, to help encourage me to do
a better job? And, what are the elements

79
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:15,075
of the gamified system that are being
employed? As we talked about, a pure

80
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:21,032
leader board, a pure ranking and scoring
system is probably the worst way to

81
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:26,089
promote the beneficial, cooperative,
engaging aspects of gamification. And

82
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:32,076
instead, promote the more vicious and
harmful kinds of gamification among

83
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:38,062
workers. Beyond that, I leave it you to
think about this question but it's an

84
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:44,049
important one for any company to take into
account when going down the path of

85
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:50,017
putting game-like systems into their
workplace.
