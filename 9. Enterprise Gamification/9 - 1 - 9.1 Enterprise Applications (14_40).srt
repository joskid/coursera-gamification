00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,011
This week, we're going to work at some
specific applications of gamefication.

2
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:10,030
Many of the examples I've given you are in
the external gamefication bucket. They're

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,061
about customer facing types of uses. In
this unit I'm going to look at internal

4
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:20,046
gamefication and specifically,
gamefication in the enterprise. In a large

5
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:25,031
business organization. Many major
enterprises are starting to experiment

6
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:30,063
with gamefication and to apply it in
concrete situations. Sometimes consciously

7
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:36,003
thinking that they are trying to gamify a
process, sometimes just using a technique

8
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:40,082
that seems to work that when we look at
it, we would identify as being part of

9
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:45,427
gamification. The research firm
Constellation Research, put out a report

10
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:50,028
at the end of last year, where they talked
to 55 different early adopters of

11
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:55,040
enterprise gamification and found a wide
range of different kinds of uses within

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,369
the enterprise. I'd like to highlight few
examples for you, major areas where I see

13
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:06,419
potential take up by enterprises and give
you an example for each of them. The first

14
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:11,029
is intranets or extranets, online
collaboration systems that companies

15
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:16,046
operate for their employees or their
extended networks. And gamification works

16
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:21,025
here just like it does in external setting
with a discussion forum like

17
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:26,062
StackOverflow. The game elements can be
used to encourage people to contribute, to

18
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:31,025
encourage people to comment and respond,
to enhance the quality of the

19
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:36,034
participation that people engage in, and
to develop leader boards to identify

20
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:41,064
people who have the most expertise or the
most involvement in certain topics. So,

21
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:46,408
here you see a set of leader boards for
the SAP Community network, which is the

22
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:52,002
extra net for the Enterprise software
company, SAP and their network of

23
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:57,018
developers that interact with SAP software
at other companies. And they very

24
00:01:57,018 --> 00:02:02,049
actively, use gamification techniques to
enhance the quality of the discussion in

25
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,067
that forum. So, that's an enterprise case
because it is being used internally by an

26
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:12,059
enterprise, but the same basic dynamics
that we saw in StackOverflow and re ally

27
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:17,002
any other discussion forum kind of
application. The next one though is

28
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:21,097
different. This is about productivity, and
when I say productivity enhancement, I

29
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:27,012
mean, helping or encouraging employees to
do their core job better. There are many

30
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:32,055
different examples of this and there are
many different kinds of jobs. So, what it

31
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:37,092
takes to motivate a sales person maybe
different from what it takes to motivate

32
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:43,001
an accountant or a financial analyst. But,
in almost every case, gamification can

33
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:48,018
produce motivation and can provide
information and feedback that is valuable

34
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:53,041
to employees and helps them improve their
job performance. Here's one concrete

35
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:58,097
example which comes from call centers. So,
call centers have large numbers of agents

36
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:03,093
and they have to encourage those agents
to, first of all, deal with calls quickly

37
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:08,078
because the longer they're on the phone,
the more cost there is for the customer.

38
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:13,003
And at the same time they want to
encourage the agents to deal with

39
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:17,066
customers well because the ultimate
customers, the customers of the people

40
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:22,072
using the call center business will tend
to be upset if the agent is clueless or

41
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:27,079
surly or anything like that. So, the call
center operators are starting to look to

42
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,066
gamification as a technique to help them
manage these customer service agents

43
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:37,060
better. This is an example from a start-up
called Arcarus which is specifically

44
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,049
focused on this call center enterprise
market. And you see here on the right, a

45
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:47,050
screen that would come up for an agent and
it's got a leader board, she's number one.

46
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,083
It's got a set of levels that she can
achieve by virtue of her various

47
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:56,082
activities on dealing with calls. It's got
some customer satisfaction numbers that

48
00:03:56,082 --> 00:04:01,062
show some data on how she's doing and it's
got achievement. So all the standard

49
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:06,031
gamification elements but here, focused in
specifically on encouraging better

50
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:11,012
performance for a customer service agent
and highlighting the key elements and

51
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:15,099
designed in an aesthetic way that works
for that application. This here that you

52
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:21,026
see on the left is a screen that the
company might ge t looking at key

53
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:26,082
performance indicators, that's what KPI
stands for, and integrating in those

54
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:32,016
business metrics with the data coming out
of the gamification engine allowing them

55
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:37,041
to monitor their employee performance and
use the gamification system to improve the

56
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:42,047
level of productivity. Now, let me put a
placeholder here which I'm going to expand

57
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:47,023
on later that there's a danger in this
kind of application. That the gamified

58
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:52,011
system could actually rather than helping
the call center agents be a tool for

59
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:57,030
oppressing them and constantly monitoring
their work in a way that's not helpful to

60
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:03,178
them. So let's keep that in mind as a risk
but it certainly can be done in a positive

61
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:07,750
way, which I think this is an example of.
Next category I'll call efficiency

62
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,304
enhancement. The difference between
productivity and efficiency here is

63
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:18,032
productivity is in someone's core job
responsibility. Efficiency is just about

64
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:23,019
making them work better by doing
everything they do at work efficiently,

65
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:28,040
and specifically, the example I want to
talk about is e-mail. So lots and lots of

66
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,068
workers spend time in their e-mail. And
it's not their job primarily to answer

67
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:38,033
e-mail, but they have to do it as part of
their job. And people waste tons and tons

68
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:42,099
of time, countless hours answering e-mail,
getting e-mail that's irrelevant, cleaning

69
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:47,058
out their mailbox, and so forth. And so,
gamification is being used to improve the

70
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:52,006
efficiency of that process. The example
that I show you here is the E-mail Game

71
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:56,066
from a company called Baden. And you see
here they've got a timer so you see how

72
00:05:56,066 --> 00:06:01,014
much time you're spending in your e-mail.
You see this progress bar of how much

73
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:05,050
you've got left and you see a point
system. And the way the E-mail Game works

74
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,851
is you get points for quickly disposing of
your e-mail. For deleting it or responding

75
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:15,976
to it in a way that you can take it out of
your inbox. It incentivizes and encourages

76
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:20,784
you to deal with e-mail efficiently. And
that little nudge tends to give people

77
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:25,509
enough reason to deal with their e-mail in
a more efficient way. Saving lots and lot

78
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:30,253
s of time that gets freed up for other
things. Another interesting approach to

79
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:34,668
e-mail is being taken by a company called,
Seriosity, that has a system called a Tent

80
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:39,081
and their idea was to create a virtual
currency around e-mail. So they created a

81
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:43,612
set of tokens that you attach to e-mail
and it cost you this virtual currency to

82
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:47,836
send and receive e-mail. And the idea is
by creating this kind of virtual economy,

83
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:52,672
people will start to think about whether
it's worth sending an e-mail. Well, if it

84
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:57,068
actually cost something, only got so many
resources and I have to use some of them

85
00:06:57,068 --> 00:07:01,629
to send this e-mail, do I really want to
send all to the whole company about this

86
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,514
particular irrelevant thing or not? And so
the idea here is that by creating a

87
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:12,393
structure that provides feedback and the
ability to manipulate the activity around

88
00:07:12,393 --> 00:07:17,644
e-mail in a game-like way, people will
start to see their effects on the overall

89
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:22,513
system. That kind of system's thinking
that games can encourage and therefore be

90
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:27,601
more responsible about the email that they
send and receive. So a different approach

91
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:33,432
tackling a similar problem and there other
problems in the efficiency domain as well.

92
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:38,560
Situations where gamification can be used
to encourage people to waste less time and

93
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,269
therefore have more time for their core
jobs. The next one I don't have a

94
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:48,537
screenshot for but this is an example from
Deloitte where they an application called

95
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:53,321
WhoWhatWhere, that is used to encourage
their consultants to find out more about

96
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:58,521
each other. That's in the broad domain of
knowledge management. Companies don't

97
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:04,012
necessarily collaborate internally that
well. Especially a very knowledge oriented

98
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:09,264
company like a consulting firm has people
all over the world with tremendous amounts

99
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:14,044
of knowledge about customers and about
topics and yet, they don't necessarily

100
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:19,104
know about each other. And it would be
really helpful for the company if when a

101
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:23,051
consultant in Cleveland had a question
about say, supply chain process

102
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:27,938
improvements in the oil and gas industry,
that they would be able to quickly see who

103
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:33,052
else in my company has worked on those
engagements or who else has real knowledge

104
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:38,063
about that area. So, gamification can be a
way of encouraging people to provide that

105
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:42,091
information into the system and
facilitating a process that encourages

106
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:47,060
that kind of sharing. The WhoWhatWhere
system at Deloitte does that by creating

107
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,008
game mechanics around the consultants
sharing information about what they're

108
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:56,051
doing on their existing enterprise
collaboration system. And other companies

109
00:08:56,051 --> 00:09:00,094
are starting to use similar kinds of
applications to encourage that kind of

110
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:05,058
lightweight knowledge sharing. There are a
variety of applications in Human

111
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:10,039
Resources. Let me touch on a few of them
really quickly. Companies are using

112
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,066
gamification for hiring. Just playing
games sometimes tells you something about

113
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:20,512
people and gamified systems can be used to
identify the best candidates and to review

114
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:25,087
candidates in the hiring process.
Onboarding. Gamification is a way to get

115
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:30,087
people up and running at a company. Early
on, we talked about onboarding as an

116
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:35,090
important technique in game design. So if
you think about your HR process as a kind

117
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:40,088
of game, gamification and game techniques
can be used to onboard employees quickly.

118
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:46,028
Beyond onboarding is Acculturation,
getting people engaged in the culture of

119
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:51,342
the enterprise. And games, by creating a
fun kind of collaborative environment, can

120
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:56,026
help people get a sense of their
co-workers and the notion of working

121
00:09:56,026 --> 00:10:01,010
together as a team and can be a way to
reinforce the culture of the organization.

122
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,005
Now, if the culture of the organization is
very formal and serious, then a game-like

123
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:10,088
system may not be the best way to do it.
But if not, or in a wide variety of other

124
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:15,053
contexts, a game-like system may be a
great way to ease people into a sense of

125
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:20,363
how we do things here and what the nature
is of our culture. Corporate training easy

126
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:25,000
way to see that, that applies to
gamification using game mechanics to

127
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,028
encourage people and reward people for the
learning that they do within the

128
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:34,027
organization and various kinds of training
programs. Performance review and employee

129
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:38,097
recognition. When we hear from Daniel
Debow who I'll do an interview with later

130
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:43,001
in this segment, his company uses
gamification for informal employee

131
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:47,059
rewards. Telling people you did a great
job in the enterprise and providing a

132
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:52,064
structure around that activity and have it
renowned to the benefit of the company. We

133
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:57,776
can also think of gamification being used
in the more structured, formal process of

134
00:10:57,776 --> 00:11:02,960
performance reviews, by expanding out to
things like badges and achievements and

135
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,580
other forms of recognition. And by
encouraging employees to contribute to 360

136
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,760
reviews of their co-workers. And finally
T&E, travel and entertainment. Here's an

137
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,676
example from Google. For their travel and
entertainment reimbursement they give

138
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:22,686
people a fixed amount that they can
recover for a particular two city travel

139
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:27,638
pair they went, that they were traveling
to. And then what they do is they create a

140
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:33,010
virtual economy. So if you don't use the
full amount you're granted, you can bank

141
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:38,431
it, you can give it to charity or you can
cash it out, though at a discount. And

142
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:43,629
this makes that kind of credit liquid in a
way, which encourages people to think

143
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:48,257
about creatively using it. To be more
efficient about their use of that travel

144
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:52,683
and entertainment currency which
previously employees didn't think about as

145
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:57,237
a currency or a game at all. They just
thought about it as a process of getting

146
00:11:57,237 --> 00:12:01,148
reimbursement. Here employees are
encouraged to think about how to spend

147
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:05,019
efficiently because then they bank
additional currency that they can use

148
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:09,052
either for themselves or for charitable
donations. Next one is innovation.

149
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:14,073
Companies want to encourage their
employees to come up with great new ideas.

150
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:19,971
So this is an example from the Department
of Work and Pensions in the UK, a public

151
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:25,476
governmental organization not necessarily
the kind of organization known for great

152
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:30,202
innovation. What they've done is they
built something called Idea Street which

153
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:35,632
is an idea market place. So, to encourage
people within their organization to come

154
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:40,867
up w ith great ideas to improve their
service, they created a virtual stock

155
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:46,390
market. So, employees come up with ideas
and you can see some ideas here. And other

156
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,590
employees can essentially buy and sell
shares in those ideas. There's a price,

157
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:56,963
daily change, volume, total market cap.
And here's the link where you can buy and

158
00:12:56,963 --> 00:13:01,686
sell it. And they've created a
stock-market-like marketplace around these

159
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:06,607
ideas. So, great ideas start to float to
the top. People can join in on teams that

160
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:11,432
have ideas that they think are cool and
that are effective and that encourages

161
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:16,536
more activity on those ideas and what they
found is they've generated a large number

162
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:21,578
of ideas that have actually been put into
place in the organization saving millions

163
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:26,071
of dollars, or millions of pounds in the
UK, and actually delivering better service

164
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:30,669
to their constituencies, using these game
mechanics to make the process of coming up

165
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:35,584
with innovative ideas more game like as
opposed to just the suggestion box that

166
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:40,606
you just drop an idea in. Finally, there
are many examples of serious games in the

167
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:45,111
enterprise. So here's an example from
Siemens. The electronics and

168
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:51,004
telecommunications company where they have
created something called Plantville which

169
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:55,567
is a simulation of one of their
manufacturing plants. And they've created

170
00:13:55,567 --> 00:14:00,456
a game around operating a manufacturing
plant. So this is something that can be

171
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:05,545
used for training. It's something that can
be used for other purposes to help people

172
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:11,011
understand how to be more effective in the
process of managing one of their plants.

173
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:16,124
That is I would call a, what I would call
a serious game, because it's a full-blown

174
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:21,391
game, so worth talking about within this
overall context, but worth putting, on to

175
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:26,593
the side for the moment because I want to
focus most specifically on uses of game

176
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:31,265
elements and structures that get
incorporated into existing businesses. So,

177
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:37,624
as we see a wide variety of different
kinds of applications in different kinds

178
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:41,026
of enterprises all using gamification.
