00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,057
There is an interesting and important
distinction that comes up in enterprise

2
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:16,038
gamification, which is the dividing line
between the game on one side and the job

3
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:23,029
on the other. Why is this important? Well,
it's important for a number of reasons.

4
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:28,087
But the core is that, if you're designing
a gamified system in the enterprise, what

5
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:34,011
you hear about is ultimately the job. The
goal is to motivate employees to do

6
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:39,069
something that's a business benefit. The
game is a means to that end. But for the

7
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:45,089
players, for the employees, they may well
be focused on the game. The game is the

8
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:52,026
thing that engages them. And to the extent
that there's a diversion, to the extent

9
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:58,050
that the game is pushing them one way and
the job is pushing them another way that

10
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,034
leads to real problems because again, the
players have a strong tendency to go in

11
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:10,254
the direction that the game pushes them as
opposed to what their job really should be

12
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:16,068
about. So, think about as an example, a
call center. And the call center sets up a

13
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:23,323
game or a gamified system using points and
badges and leader boards and so forth as

14
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:30,512
we, as we've seen. And then sets the rules
of the game with something like, if you

15
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:40,061
get done with a call complete a call in
less than 30 seconds, you get ten points.

16
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:48,047
And if you complete more than a certain
number of calls in an hour, you get 50

17
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:54,020
points, and so on and so forth. And all of
the structures in the game are around the

18
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,059
volume and the speed of the calls. What
are people going to do? The call center

19
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:05,012
agents are going to try to get customers
off the phone as fast as they possibly

20
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:10,051
can. Not to provide good service to them,
but just to get them off the phone to

21
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:15,062
optimize against the game. On the other
hand, if you have the same gamified

22
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:27,015
structure, but the points are for things
like good customer satisfaction. So the

23
00:02:27,015 --> 00:02:33,062
customer says that, you did a great job
when they get surveyed afterwards, you get

24
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:39,065
100 points for that. And that's what the
game rewards, or, you get a bonus reward

25
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:45,039
if you get a streak of customer sat, you
got above a certain level in customer

26
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,091
satisfaction, five calls in a row, you get
500 bonus points. Then the game is

27
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:56,036
encouraging people to optimize on
satisfaction. Now, we still don't know in

28
00:02:56,036 --> 00:03:01,057
this very general hypothetical whether
this matches up perfectly with the job

29
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:06,068
requirements. So certainly, if the system
is designed just to create call center

30
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:11,047
agents who want to get customers off the
phone as fast as possible at any cost,

31
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:16,020
that's not likely to be something that
companies are going to want. At least

32
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,018
companies that are thoughtful how their
long term interest in their customer

33
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:26,018
perceptions. But the question about how
important it is to optimize on customer

34
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:30,068
satisfaction versus something else is a
busineness, business decision that the

35
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:35,023
company ultimately that, that is the
customer of the call center or the company

36
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:40,014
operating the call center needs to figure
out. And then the structures of the

37
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:45,096
gamified system have to be designed to
motivate towards those business goals. So,

38
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:51,086
this ties back in to the element of the
design framework that I gave you earlier

39
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:57,054
on to first figure out what the business
goals are, and then go through the

40
00:03:57,054 --> 00:04:03,000
gamification process. It's always
important to focus on the job, or the task

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,036
at hand because otherwise, people will
optimize themselves on the game. The

42
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:13,067
second dimension here is that sometimes
people are motivated at work for things

43
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:18,052
outside the job in a good way. And that
refers to corporate citizenship,

44
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:23,099
citizenship behaviors, situations where
people will do things at work just to be

45
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:28,067
nice to colleagues or to be good for the
company. So, some of the ones that get

46
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:33,035
mentioned here Altruism, people will do
things just to be good to other people.

47
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:38,262
Consciousness, people will work hard and
want to do good job just because they take

48
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:42,069
pride in what they do. Civic Virtue, a
sense that you are part of a larger

49
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:47,061
community and you care about doing your
part for the community, even though it's a

50
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:51,588
business community where you work as
opposed to a social community at home.

51
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:56,078
Common Courtesy and Sportsmanship being
fair to others. These are n ormal human

52
00:04:56,078 --> 00:05:02,026
motivations, and they're true for people
at work as well. And, they can be tapped

53
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:07,070
into for the benefit of the company. In
various examples using gamification, the

54
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,073
one that I gave you before was the
Microsoft Language Quality game, which

55
00:05:12,073 --> 00:05:18,003
tapped into people's desire to make
Windows a better product by volunteering

56
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:24,010
their time to find localization bugs. Ross
Smith, who is the head of the test group

57
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,090
at Microsoft that implimented the language
quality game and several other

58
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:36,001
productivity games, has developed a
framework to understand which applications

59
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:42,091
lend themselves well to this approach. And
his structure involves two different kinds

60
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:51,087
of behavior or tasks, and three different
kinds of skills. So the two kinds of

61
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:59,071
behavior are first, what he calls In-Role
behavior, i.e. What you're doing for your

62
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:04,069
job. It's something that's part of your
normal job description. And then

63
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:10,017
Citizenship behaviors, things that you do
at work to be a good employee, a good

64
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:15,029
citizen of the organization, not
necessarily the specific things that you

65
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:20,063
are hired to do and compensated for. And
then he talks about, three different

66
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:26,024
categories of skills. One set or what he
calls Core Skills which are skills that

67
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:33,062
everyone in the organization has. The next
are Unique Skills, skills that are limited

68
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:39,056
to a particular employee or group of, of
employees. And next, Future Skills, skills

69
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:45,088
that an employee would like to obtain. And
Smith says, these productivity games,

70
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:51,068
Things like the language quality game
designed to improve productivity in the

71
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:58,528
workplace are best used in just two of the
sections of this chart. The first one is

72
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:04,128
for core roles that involve citizenship
behavior or core skills I should say, that

73
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:09,492
involve citizenship behavior. And this is
where the language quality game fits. So,

74
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:14,544
this is a skill that everyone in the
company has, the skill is speaking your

75
00:07:14,544 --> 00:07:19,839
own language. It doesn't require anything
unique to you, any particular training.

76
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,336
Anyone who is a native speaker of the
language where the office is can easily

77
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:30,229
review dialogue boxes in their n ative
language. And they're going to do it not

78
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:35,131
because it's their job but because it's
part of being a good corporate citizen.

79
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:40,019
So, the fact that the language quality
game is down here and not an in role kind

80
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:44,764
of task. Is what enables it. Because if
it's a core skill and it's an in-role kind

81
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,643
of task is what enables it because if it's
a core skill and it's an in-role kind of

82
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:51,907
task then there's not as good a fit for
something that is designed to be fun and

83
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:55,304
game-like. The only reason to motivate you
to do something that everyone in the

84
00:07:55,304 --> 00:08:00,181
company can do is if it's part of this
kind of collaborative activity. The other

85
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:04,847
category where he says gamification or
productivity games work well is up here.

86
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:08,926
So, it's in-role. It's your actual job
responsibilities but it's about future

87
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:14,305
skills. It's about things that you want to
learn how to do. That's where gamification

88
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:19,196
and productivity games can help in terms
of training and improving people's

89
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:24,237
behavior. Really what I think Smith is
getting at here is that there are two big

90
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:29,331
categories of gamification application to
the workplace. One involves groups, it

91
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:33,575
involves community. Trying to get
participation from as many people as

92
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:38,713
possible within the organization. The
other involves individuals and typically

93
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:43,778
involves improving their skills or
improving their performance at work. Those

94
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:49,291
are very different and one is better done
in an, an example that's focused on actual

95
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:54,252
job responsibilities, and one is better
done outside of that environment. If it,

96
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:59,287
the situation though involves unique
skills, people's unique capabilities but

97
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:05,131
it's skills they already have, a game-like
structure may not be as effective because

98
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:10,354
it doesn't create a level playing field
for people to interact on. If it's not

99
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:15,297
about training and problem solving but
just showing what you can do, then there's

100
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:20,601
not really an environment for a game or
for a proper application of gamification.

101
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:25,530
So, all of this goes to emphasize the
point that enterprise gamification

102
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:31,249
requires a close attention to the nature
of the game and how that match es up with

103
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:37,086
the different sorts of objectives and
motivations in the workplace.
