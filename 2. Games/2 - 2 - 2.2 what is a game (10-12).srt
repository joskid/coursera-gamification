1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,086
What is a game? Seems like a fairly
obvious question, we all know what games

2
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:16,013
are, we all play games. So, it's easy to
define, right? A game is a game. Turns out

3
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:20,625
that it's extraordinarily difficult when
you think about it, to figure out what it

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:26,339
is that makes something a game. And we
don't want to get too hung up on semantics

5
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,295
here. It's not that in order to do a
gamification, you need to get some

6
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:37,169
approval by the official game board that
what you're doing truly involves games.

7
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:42,559
But to understand how to tap into the
power of games. And to understand how to

8
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,387
create things that are actually game-like,
would help to have as a starting point an

9
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:53,358
understanding of what a game is. So, it
turns out that this is a deep,

10
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:59,169
philosophical question. And there've been
a number of works by major philosophers

11
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:04,622
that've taken on just this challenge,
defining what a game is. And of course,

12
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:09,885
this is not a philosophy course, but it's
helpful to understand some of those

13
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:15,374
perspectives because as we'll see, they
teach lessons that are going to be very

14
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:20,805
valuable in understanding the power of
games as used for gamification. The

15
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:26,023
starting point here is Ludwig
Wittgenstein. Hello Ludwig. Famous

16
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:32,460
twentieth century philosopher and in his
masterpiece philosophical investigations,

17
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,540
Wittgenstein used games as one of his core
examples about the difficulty, in fact the

18
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,044
impossibility of using language to define
things. The point that he made, or the

19
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:51,979
argument that he made, was that it is
impossible to define what a game is. We

20
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:58,122
think that we know what games are and we
have no trouble pointing to something in

21
00:01:58,122 --> 00:02:03,562
the real world, and saying, aha, that's a
game. Back here, I have Cranium, that's a

22
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:09,068
game. Back here, I have a bowling trophy,
that's a trophy about someone playing a

23
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:15,537
game. We understand what games are, right?
Well, it's gets harder to say what is the

24
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:22,641
framework that defines games? How can you
give a concise definition of games that is

25
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:29,083
comprehensive? So, maybe think about it a
little for yourself the question is, given

26
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:35,684
all the different kinds of games, what is
it that ties together hopscotch, and Call

27
00:02:35,684 --> 00:02:41,535
of Duty, and water polo and all of the
different kinds of things that we talk

28
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:47,037
about as games, there is not one aspect
that you can find in common. Many of them

29
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:52,455
have points or scoring, many of them have
winning and loosing, many of them have

30
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:57,474
teams but, there's no one thing like that,
that applies to all games. So,

31
00:02:57,474 --> 00:03:04,020
Wittgenstein's point here in philosophical
investigations, was you can't figure out,

32
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,208
as he says, how the concept of a game is
bounded. What counts as a game and what no

33
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,596
longer does, he says, can you give the
boundary, no. So, Wittgenstein's argument

34
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:20,689
is impossible to ask to define games.
Well, fortunately that's not the endpoint

35
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:26,064
or we wouldn't have much to say here.
Other philosophers took up this challenge.

36
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:31,820
One of the more interesting was a Candian
philosopher named Bernard Suits, and Suits

37
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,407
took on Wittgenstein, Wittgenstein
directly, and said, actually Ludwig, we

38
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:41,471
can define what a game is. Wittgenstein,
of course, was really not trying to make a

39
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:46,565
point about games. He was trying to make a
point about the indeterminacy of language,

40
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:51,521
and the nature of human thought. But Suits
was focused specifically on games. And

41
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:57,053
what Suits says is, we can define every
possible game based on three concepts. The

42
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:03,580
first is, that games have when he called a
Pre-lusory Goal. Lusory here comes from

43
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:10,067
the Latin word ludus which means game.
We'll see it again in a different context.

44
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:16,491
So the first thing Suits said was, in any
game there's some objective of the game.

45
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:23,465
If you're playing ping pong, table tennis,
the objective is to hit a ball over a net.

46
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:30,036
You can talk about a hitting a ball over a
net without regard to the game of ping

47
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:36,774
pong. If the game is the 400-meter race,
the goal is to get from the starting point

48
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:43,445
to the finish line of the race. If the
game is checkers, the goal is to capture

49
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:50,107
all of your opponent's pieces. We can talk
about that without necessarily referring

50
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:55,621
to all the rules of any of those games.
So, first thing we need is a goal. We've

51
00:04:55,621 --> 00:05:01,017
already talked about this, games have goal
S. The second thing you need, is what

52
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:06,811
Suits called constitutive rules. A set of
rules or limitations that make the

53
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:12,785
activity into a game. So if it's checkers,
the rules include the fact that the pieces

54
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:17,759
can only move one space diagonally and
only forward until they become a king. And

55
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,136
they can only capture by jumping over
diagonally if there's an open square on

56
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:26,621
the other side. If it's Ping Pong, the
rules include, the ball can't bounce twice

57
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:31,704
on your side, you have to hit it over the
net, and it has to land on your opponents

58
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:36,517
side of the table. Any game has those
rules, and those rules are what make it

59
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:42,075
game-like as supposed to just some work
objective. The third element is what

60
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:47,679
Suits' called a lusory attitude. So,
there's that word again lusory, a

61
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:53,776
game-like attitude. What that means is,
the player follows the rules, and they do

62
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:59,508
so voluntarily. They do so because they
have an attitude that says the game means

63
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:04,838
something. Sure, I could play ping pong
with an air cannon and using a baseball

64
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:11,309
and fire it a hundred miles an hour across
the table, not just at my opponent side of

65
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:17,552
the table, but directly at my opponents
head. And I could do that and say ha, ha,

66
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:23,145
I had hit the ball over the net, I win the
game, but that, whatever, that was,

67
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:29,058
[laugh] wouldn't be ping pong. And the
point is, if I care about ping pong, then

68
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:34,857
I'm not going to do that, that's cheating.
I can win the 400-meter race by racing

69
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:40,507
directly across the infield cutting across
in a shortcut to the finish line but

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:45,559
that's cheating and that is doing
something other than effectively playing

71
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:51,067
the game of a 400-meter race. So, the
point here is if it's a game, it means

72
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:56,852
something to the players. They want to
follow the rules of the game, even though

73
00:06:56,852 --> 00:07:01,973
they limit the player's freedom. So,
another way the Suits put this was the

74
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:07,843
game is voluntarily overcoming unnecessary
obstacles. There are obstacles on our

75
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:13,427
path, we don't have to overcome them and
yet we do. Voluntarily, a game must be

76
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:17,916
voluntary for to be a game. So, think
about how this relates to gamification.

77
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:23,346
First of all , think about how it relates
to every game you can think of. Try and

78
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:28,251
think about different games and how they
might fit into Suits three part tasks. But

79
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:33,714
then think about what it means if a game
something that's voluntary, something that

80
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:38,177
has an objective, something that has
limitations and something that has the

81
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:42,549
player thinking that the game has
meaningful so that they follow the rules

82
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:48,142
of the game. The final piece of the puzzle
comes from the work of an early to mid

83
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:53,669
twentieth century dutch philosopher named
Johan Huizinga and he wrote a book that

84
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,337
became very influential called Homo
Ludens. Ludens from that same Latin word

85
00:07:58,337 --> 00:08:03,334
ludus as the lusory attitude that Bernard
Suits talks about. And the book is an

86
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:09,524
extended argument that games and play are
essential to what makes us human even to

87
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:15,716
the serious things in life like religion
and government and the legal system. But

88
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:21,933
the point that I want to emphasize here is
a concept that Huizinga developed in the

89
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:28,525
book called the Magic Circle. And his idea
was that in a game there is a physical or

90
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:36,663
a virtual boundary that divides the world
of the game from, what we could call, the

91
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:43,935
real world. In other words the game is
different. It might be a traditional

92
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:49,684
physical boundary, like for example the
lines around a soccer field. If you are on

93
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:55,152
the pitch, you are playing the game, if
you are in the stands, you're not. But it

94
00:08:55,152 --> 00:09:01,019
might also, might also be a conceptual
boundary. When you sit down and started to

95
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:06,423
play a video game, you are in a virtual
way embedding yourself in the game. And

96
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:11,474
the point is, when you are in the magic
circle, the game rules matter, not the

97
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:16,976
rules of the real world. So, this ties in
to Suit's notion of voluntariness and a

98
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:22,458
lusory attitude, but the notion is that we
are essentially in a virtual environment.

99
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:27,465
Whether we are, again , on a playing field
or looking at a computer screen, we're

100
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:32,966
thinking that the game matters and we
should follow the rules of the game, more

101
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:38,641
so than focusing on following the rules of
the real world. Now, gamification as I've

102
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:43,603
said, involves elements of ga mes, and
concepts, and techniques from games rather

103
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:48,567
than full blown games. So, the challenge
and the opportunity for gamification is to

104
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:53,584
put the player as much as possible in the
magic circle. If you feel like the game

105
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:58,523
matters, whether that's Club Psyche, or
Kiss, or the Speed Camera Lottery, or any

106
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:03,646
of the examples I've given. If the player
feels like that's important, those are

107
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:08,390
real constraints, then they will be
motivated to play and to respond to the

108
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,051
incentives that the gamified system
provides.
