1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,087
Up until now I've been talking about games
in a very general, abstract sense, because

2
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:11,074
gamification draws upon basic principles
that are common to all games. But it also

3
00:00:11,074 --> 00:00:17,241
draws specifically upon a certain category
of games namely, video games. And most of

4
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:22,661
the gamification examples that we're going
to think about, involve online digital

5
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:28,434
systems which are directly related to what
we see in video games. So, it's worth

6
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:33,743
understanding the video game industry.
Also because the size of it and the scale

7
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:40,604
of it and the pervasiveness of it are part
of why the motifs of gamification are so

8
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:49,434
familiar. So, we start 40 years ago, 1972
or so with Pong. The first mass market

9
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:55,308
successful video game still gives me
chills. Here it is. Pong was a revolution

10
00:00:55,826 --> 00:01:01,867
play. There it is. Because it allowed
people to interact with what was on their

11
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:08,919
screen. If, by today's standards of course
was unbelievably primitive and it's hard

12
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:16,025
to imagine how anyone would get interested
in what you see behind me on the screen

13
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:22,544
there. But Pong for the first time, gave
people the power to interact with a

14
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:28,531
digital game at home. And since then, the
video game industry has grown and grown,

15
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:34,063
and now as I said, It's 40 years old. It
is both substantial as a business

16
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:40,049
phenomenon, pervasive in the experience of
especially the younger generation of

17
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:46,049
people particularly in the west but in
many other parts of the world as well. And

18
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,005
video games have developed a very
sophisticated language of how to express

19
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:57,085
themselves, and entertain and engage
people. Here's one example just to show

20
00:01:57,085 --> 00:02:03,058
what I'm talking about here. This is
Cityville, one of the casual social games

21
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:09,046
on Facebook made by Zinga. And Cityville
as you can see is clearly a game and a

22
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:15,049
fairly graphically simple game. At least
compare to some of the rich 3D immersive

23
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:21,045
games that we have on consoles and PCs
today. Here's the interesting thing about

24
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:29,189
Cityville. Cityville was launched by Zynga
in 2011. In 41 days, it hit a hundred

25
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:36,738
million registered users. Six Weeks. Zero
to a, a hundred million registered users.

26
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:41,854
An extraor dinary rate of growth and it's
not limited to just this one game or this

27
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:47,749
one company. This is a huge phenomenon.
So, here's some statistics to capture just

28
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:53,709
how big the video game industry is today.
The industry depending on who's numbers

29
00:02:53,709 --> 00:03:00,090
you take is somewhere on the order of 60
to 80 billion dollars a year in revenues.

30
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,098
Double the revenues of Hollywood from box
office sales of films. Films make money

31
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:11,001
from other mechanism as well, including
tie ins with games. But if you talk about

32
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:16,004
box office revenues games are already much
bigger and their growing faster than

33
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:21,006
Hollywood. The second is that games are
evolving to the point where online games,

34
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:25,096
games played or distributed online as
opposed to on consoles like the Play

35
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:30,074
Station and XBox and Nintendo Wii. Or
downloaded in a box and loaded on a PC.

36
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:35,079
The online games are growing faster and
are poised. To become the biggest segment

37
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,066
of the games marketplace, and
interestingly, already the biggest

38
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:44,080
component of the online games marketplace
is China. So it's not just an American or

39
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,064
a Western phenomenon. The third is that
games are becoming the foundation for

40
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:54,050
other industries. Virtual goods, I will
talk about later in the class, but these

41
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,047
are things that you can buy within the
game. Think about a brand new sword for a

42
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:04,058
player in a massively multi-player online
game. Or some additional seeds and other

43
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:09,056
equipment that you might use in a Zynga
game like Farmville. Things that you pay

44
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:14,079
real money for that appear in the game.
This economy around virtual goods is

45
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:20,062
already many billions of dollars, 7.3
billion globally and two billion in the

46
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:26,045
US, according to the latest statistics I
could find. A very substantial market

47
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:31,012
which is not games themselves but
something built on top of the great

48
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:36,011
success of games. And finally the other
great evolution is the rise of mobile

49
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:41,055
games. This was a study early in 2012 that
found that 44 percent of people, US and

50
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:46,086
UK, have played a mobile game something
like an Angry Birds on their smartphone in

51
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:52,010
the last month. So, the games industry is
big and it's developing. And I think it's

52
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:57,054
fair to talk about it as the mass medium
of the twenty-first century. Here are just

53
00:04:57,054 --> 00:05:02,087
a few statistics about usage numbers. If
you look at things like the Zynga Games,

54
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:07,664
lots of people. I talked about a hundred
million on Cityville 250 million, quarter

55
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:12,787
of a billion unique registered users, and
that it was already probably a few months

56
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:17,468
old. They've surpassed that. Angry Birds
alone over a hundred million. Xbox LIVE

57
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:21,500
games 35, World of Warcraft over ten
million players. World of Warcraft, those

58
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,128
are paying players, so that's even more
important in terms of monetization. The

59
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:31,639
other important piece though is how much
time people are using these things. And so

60
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,566
those ten million World of Warcraft
players up here, if you look at the amount

61
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:42,098
of time they spend, it's actually huge.
It's 50 billion minutes a month because

62
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:48,016
they're playing for long periods of time.
Where as something like Angry Birds, even

63
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:53,066
though it has a higher user base is only a
mere twelve billion minutes a month that

64
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:58,061
people are playing because people use it
less. Still a pretty big number. And if

65
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:03,045
you look at something like the Xbox Live
games, which are the core console games so

66
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:08,230
therefore games people play more. 120
billion minutes a month. So, figure out

67
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,677
how much that is across the player base,
and figure out how much time that actually

68
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:17,887
represents relative to traditional media.
It's not the same thing as people having

69
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:22,113
their television on for seven hours a day
in the time, but this is interactive time

70
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:26,803
it's time when the player is directly
engaged in playing the game. Big, big

71
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:33,455
numbers. So, the important thing here to
take away is that games are a mass

72
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:39,040
phenomenon. And just to correct a
misunderstanding that people sometimes

73
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,013
have, they are not just a mass phenomenon
for teenage boys. It's true that the

74
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:51,060
highest percentage of gamers is teenagers
and young adults, twelve to seventeen year

75
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,095
olds in the US. This study by the Peer
Research Foundation found 97 percent play

76
00:06:56,095 --> 00:07:02,035
some kind of video game. Virtually
everyone. But it's not just them. And the

77
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:07,213
Entertainment Software Association has f
ound that the average gamer is actually 30

78
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:12,229
years old. And if you know anything about
averages, that means there's a whole lot

79
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:16,603
of them that are older than 30. Moreover
it's not just boys or men. Almost half of

80
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:21,454
all video game players today are women.
There are some skewing effects. Women

81
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:26,392
generally speaking tend to play more the
social, casual games. Men tend to play

82
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:31,801
more of the first person shooter types of
games. But overall if you talk about video

83
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:36,969
games as an experience, as a mass medium,
as a phenomenon that people are conversant

84
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:42,014
with and familiar with, it cuts across all
those boundaries. And the final point is

85
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:47,173
that video games are not just going in and
guns blazing blowing something up and

86
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:52,142
shooting things. Sure, there are games
that involve that. And some of them have

87
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:56,891
been very successful. But especially in
recent years, we've seen the rise of many

88
00:07:56,891 --> 00:08:00,677
different categories of games that are
very different. So for example, the

89
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:05,298
Sandbox games things like Minecraft, which
if you're not familiar with you should go

90
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:09,933
check out. Minecraft is a game that was
written by a single developer that is

91
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:13,853
incredibly rudimentary in terms of its
graphics, has no purpose. You go into

92
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:18,802
Minecraft, you're given a world. And you
have to dig things up and find different

93
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:23,187
kinds of ore and chop down trees and do
other things to create raw materials and

94
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:28,398
then put them together in different ways
and build things. Why? Well, because it's

95
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:34,522
fun. And it turns out that Minecraft has
been a sensation. Huge numbers of users

96
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:40,729
voluntarily pay money to play this game.
Which or, and most of the time that they

97
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,693
were doing so was far from finish. It was
expressly in alpha or beta form, people

98
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:49,141
found this incredibly compelling. In part
because they could share their creations

99
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:53,233
with other people. It gave them a huge
Sandbox. You could make anything you want

100
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:57,029
in Minecraft. Another category are the
building games, or here I mentioned

101
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,985
already, Civilization by Sid Meier, the
SimCity games by Will Wright, games that

102
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:05,404
let you create and build things. Again,
not to kill them. But to figure out how

103
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:11,677
your actions in running a complex system
like a city or like a nation state create

104
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:17,421
results as they interact with each other
and with other parts of the system. A

105
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:22,391
derivative of those are what I'll call
social building games. Here's where we see

106
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:27,100
things like Farmville and the Sims. Games
that have that construction building

107
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,186
element, but also involve collaborating
with and interacting with other players in

108
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:35,106
the game. Showing off what you're doing
for other players, having a social

109
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:39,961
dimension in addition to that building
dimension. Very popular, very successful.

110
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:44,060
Then we have the massively multiplayer
online games, things like World of

111
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,910
Warcraft, which again have been quite
successful and do have some measure of

112
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,994
running around and killing things but also
have guilds and communities, and things

113
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:59,376
like auction houses and things like
leveling up characters in different skill

114
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:05,707
areas and crafting and exploring worlds. A
rich experience much more than just the

115
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:11,394
pure competitive, pure destruction element
of games. And finally, puzzle games,

116
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:17,023
things like Angry Birds, where you have to
figure out how do I pull this slingshot

117
00:10:17,023 --> 00:10:22,013
just the right way to knock over the
structure. Or Portal and Portal two, very

118
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:28,078
successful hit game in recent years, in
which the player has to figure out how to

119
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,672
create holes in a wall that when you put
them together solve a puzzle of how to get

120
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:38,786
out of a room. If you haven't played go
and look at some YouTube videos or some

121
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:43,859
information on the game. Really
successful, powerful game using simple

122
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:49,298
kinds of problem solving mechanics. And
the point here is that these are not

123
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:54,800
outliers or exceptions. These in many
cases are the most successful game

124
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,810
releases in recent years. So, games are,
big. They are sophisticated. They are

125
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:07,045
pervasive across modern life, and they are
diverse. They are not just as simple as

126
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:13,153
you might think and they are not just
about graphics. They're about all these

127
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:18,044
different forms of interaction
individually and socially.
