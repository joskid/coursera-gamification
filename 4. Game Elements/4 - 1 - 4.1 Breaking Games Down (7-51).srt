00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,023
In this unit I'm going to talk about
designing using game elements. Now that

2
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:10,414
you've oriented yourself to think like a
game designer, how do you practically take

3
00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:16,019
things out of games and apply them to
business practices. As I mentioned in the

4
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:21,057
introductory unit, game elements are your
toolbox for gamification. So think about

5
00:00:21,057 --> 00:00:27,009
it, if you're trying to build a house, you
wouldn't go out to the hardware store and

6
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:32,054
ask to buy a house gun, that somehow shot
out completely formed houses. No, what you

7
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:37,055
do is you buy things like hammers, and
nails, and screwdrivers. And two by 4's

8
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:42,020
and Sheep Rock. All the different
components that you can put together in

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,017
different ways to make up a house. To make
up any kind of house or any kind of

10
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:51,088
building that you want by recombining
those elements in different ways. So

11
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:56,092
that's what we mean when we talk about
game elements. They are regular patterns.

12
00:00:56,092 --> 00:01:02,023
They are tools that we can extract from
games that we find in the wild and then

13
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:07,061
use in different ways to make business
practices more game-like. So you'll recall

14
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:12,499
I gave the example earlier on of Empires
and Allies, the Zynga game, or I showed

15
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:17,550
you the game and then showed you some of
the different kinds of elements. Things

16
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,754
like the points and the quests and the
levels and so forth. This is a template

17
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:28,824
for what games elements might look like
but let's step back and talk about what

18
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:34,157
game elements are initially. And then
we'll build up a list of common game

19
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:41,761
elements that are used in gamification. So
let me draw for you here something that

20
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:56,313
will probably be familiar to most of you.
Starting to look familiar? How about this?

21
00:01:56,313 --> 00:02:06,803
Okay. By now. You probably are recognizing
that what I've drawn is the game

22
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:13,117
Tic-Tac-Toe or in the commonwealth world
it's known as Knots and Crosses. One Of

23
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:19,180
the most popular games of all time played
for many centuries. It's a game many of us

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,827
are familiar with but what if you think
about this game Tic-tac-toe not through

25
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:29,975
the lens of the game itself. Not through
the lens of the game play. Here I am

26
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:34,970
playing. Ahah, I've forked and now this
guy's going to win but think about it

27
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,758
through the lens of elements. What are the
elements of Tic-tac-toe? What are the

28
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:43,980
regular paterns? The pieces of this game
that come together along with the

29
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,754
aesthetics and the overall experience to
generate the game play. Stop and see if

30
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:53,727
you can think about some of the different
elements that we make up the game call

31
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:59,485
Tic-tac-toe. There's no one universal list
but you can probably come up with some of

32
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:06,786
them that are fairly easy to spot. Here's
a list of elements in Tic-tac-toe that I

33
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:14,210
made. There is of course the game board
that pattern of lines that create nine

34
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:21,118
spots that you can play in and there are
the tokens as I call them, the X and the O

35
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:26,513
that you play with. There are also, there
is also the fact that Tic-Tac-Toe is a

36
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:31,011
game played with two players. Now, that's
not anywhere there on the board. It's part

37
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:36,016
of the rules of the game and it's part of
the structures of the game. The rules are

38
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:40,644
things like you play an X and then the
next player plays an O. You can only play

39
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:45,789
in one square and so forth. I'm talking
about things that structure the game that

40
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:50,110
go to the essence of what makes it
engaging or not. So one of them is

41
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,309
Tic-tac-toe is a game played between two
players who are competitive i.e one person

42
00:03:55,309 --> 00:04:00,466
wins, one person looses. It's not a bunch
of people who are collaborating to find a

43
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:05,542
solution. It's one winner and one loser in
every game or the games a draw. They take

44
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:10,577
turns, that's part of the structure of the
game. That one player goes and then the

45
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:16,307
other player goes and the game defines
certain situations where we say one player

46
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:21,775
wins. So, if in fact, I'm able to make
three x's in a row here. I have won the

47
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:27,096
game. That is called a win state.
Similarly if we get to a point where all

48
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:32,536
the boxes are filled up, and no one has
three in a row, that's a draw. And if you

49
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:36,982
saw the movie War Games, the computer
figured out somehow in its vast

50
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:41,614
intelligence that any two decently
competent Tic-tac-toe players can generate

51
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:46,511
a draw in every single game, no way to win
the gam E. Now, in that movie, that result

52
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:51,024
almost lead to nuclear war. We don't have
to worry about that but the point that I

53
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:55,469
want to make here. Is that the structure
of the game. The elements of what it takes

54
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:59,847
to win and what it takes to draw the game.
Contributes to. The gameplay. And

55
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:03,970
contributes to the way people feel in
playing Tic-Tac-Toe. How much fun it is.

56
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,214
How much people want to keep playing. How
interesting it seems and so forth. And all

57
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:12,732
of this feeds in to gamification. We start
to think about deploying these tools

58
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:17,060
systematically. There's no, one set of
elements that's always good or always bad.

59
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,643
They have to be understood in context of
the overall game. So a few other, there's,

60
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:26,482
there's no progression. Now this is a
limitation on Tic-tac-toe. It doesn't

61
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:31,628
necessarily get better or change. As you
play. There's no level one Tic-tac-toe and

62
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:36,578
then once you finish this board here you
go on to level two. Nor is there any kind

63
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:41,534
of scoring less you just keep track of who
wins each game. It's just you play the

64
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:46,404
game and you win or you lose. These are
also elements about why when you think

65
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:51,253
about it, Tic-tac-toe is a pretty bad
game. Incredibly popular for centuries of

66
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:56,233
human history and yet a game that is so
simplistic and so easy to draw that it's

67
00:05:56,233 --> 00:06:01,402
not going to hold any adult's interest for
very long. And again you can see that from

68
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:06,955
the elements that are there and some of
the elements that are missing. The ability

69
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:12,088
to progress and advance in a game and the
ability to get feedback from scoring.

70
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:17,106
Certainly not necessary as I've said but
things that tend to produce more engaging

71
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:22,453
games than games without them. So another
way to think about this is, if we talk

72
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:28,583
about a game here in the middle. And we
can think about that through the various

73
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:33,814
definitions that I gave you. At the top is
the experience. The overall impact of the

74
00:06:33,814 --> 00:06:38,123
game, what you feel like when you play the
game, that's the experience. First point

75
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:42,512
here is that. This here, the game and this
here the experience are not the same

76
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:47,362
thing. The game is the set of rules, the a
esthetics, all of the game elements. The

77
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:51,790
experience is what the player feels when
they're playing it. Those two are very

78
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:57,027
much related but they're different things
and when you're doing game design what you

79
00:06:57,027 --> 00:07:01,088
control is the game and what you try to
produce is a certain kind of experience.

80
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:06,026
The other side to this is what's down here
which are the elements. So if the

81
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:10,087
experience is the kind of gestalt, the
overall impact or feeling of the game, the

82
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:15,051
elements are the piece parts. The bits and
pieces if you build up the game from

83
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:20,025
smaller units. Than you're building up
from elements if you think about the game

84
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:25,024
in terms of its general impact. How fun it
feels and why it feels fun. You're talking

85
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:29,039
about the experience. And really both of
these are ways to think about

86
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,083
gamification. We're going to focus mostly
on going up from the elements but

87
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:38,076
gamification is also about. Again,
thinking like a game designer and trying

88
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:44,064
to understand how overall experiences that
we can understand from games. Can be put

89
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:50,238
into non-game context using things like
elements but also using other kinds of
