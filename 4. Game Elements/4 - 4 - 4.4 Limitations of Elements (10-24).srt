1
00:00:00,8 --> 00:00:01,934
Okay. 
So you've learned about all of these 

2
00:00:01,934 --> 00:00:05,556
different game elements. 
And in particularly the points, badges, 

3
00:00:05,556 --> 00:00:08,986
and leader boards. 
You're done, right? 

4
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:11,968
Wrong. 
Game elements are a starting point for 

5
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,784
gamification. 
They are raw materials and tools you can 

6
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:19,968
use and deploy. 
But, just having them only gives you part 

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,124
of what you need to know. 
And frankly, a big problem with 

8
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:26,786
gamification today. 
Is that, many companies think that just 

9
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:32,954
throwing elements onto a business process 
magically makes something gamelike. 

10
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:37,468
Magically makes it fun and engaging, 
without doing any of the really hard 

11
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:40,944
work. 
And we'll look more at this objection and 

12
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:44,360
what's accurate about it later on in the 
course when I talk about the 

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,462
pointsification argument about 
gamification. 

14
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:51,942
But for now, what's important is to 
understand that, game elements are a 

15
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:55,680
starting point. 
But not the entirety of what you need to 

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,323
do. 
And if they were, then we would take 

17
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:02,480
something like a frequent flyer program 
and say, aha. 

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,550
We've got the points. 
We've got the rewards that you get in 

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,750
terms of free travel. 
You level up this person is premier 

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,830
silver in this program. 
And you get badges here for frequent 

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,817
flyer miles. 
It's the credit card representing your 

22
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:19,890
different level. 
The progress bars. 

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,398
Remember the LinkedIn progress bar? 
ha, people will love that. 

24
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:26,230
Ooh, and status. 
We haven't really talked about this yet. 

25
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,520
But often, a claim that's made about 
gamification is that it's very powerful. 

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,870
Because people love to show off their 
points and their badges and so forth. 

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,380
So here we get premier status. 
That sounds great. 

28
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,890
Well that's all there was to it. 
First of all, most people would spend all 

29
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,31
of their time just in love with their 
frequent flyer mile programs. 

30
00:01:46,31 --> 00:01:49,276
And constantly trying to play the 
frequent flyer mile game when in fact 

31
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:53,90
that's not really how people get this 
experience at all. 

32
00:01:53,90 --> 00:01:56,450
People like getting frequent flyer miles 
but, they don't think about it 

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,349
necessarily as a really engaging game. 
Except for a fairly small subset of 

34
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:05,375
hardcore fliers who do everything they 
can do optimize against their frequent 

35
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:10,193
flyer program. 
The larger point is that the elements are 

36
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:13,182
not the game. 
You'll recall earlier I said the 

37
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:16,404
experience in the game are different. 
Well, the elements in the game are 

38
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:19,322
different as well. 
The game, as I showed in that diagram is 

39
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:22,810
the thing in between the elements and the 
experience. 

40
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,586
So if you just look at the elements, you 
say oh, this site's got badges, great, 

41
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:30,783
it's got achievements, great, it's got 
quests, great. 

42
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,900
That alone doesn't tell you whether it's 
successful. 

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,340
What makes the elements successful is the 
way that they are all tied together. 

44
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,829
And often, that involves recourse to some 
of the higher level concepts, like the 

45
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,248
dynamics. 
You'll notice that points, badges, and 

46
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:49,500
leader boards all exist at the base of 
the pyramid. 

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,321
They are service level components. 
So, elements themselves don't tell you 

48
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:59,280
that the experience is fun and engaging. 
Second point. 

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,242
If you focus too heavily on the elements, 
especially on the PBLs. 

50
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:06,320
There's a real tendency to over-emphasize 
rewards. 

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,590
And I'm going to talk about this in more 
detail in the psychology section. 

52
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,190
How it is that rewards can actually 
demotivate. 

53
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,250
So saying if you do this, you will get 
either a badge or maybe even a cash 

54
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,192
prize. 
Can actually make people less likely to 

55
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:26,190
engage in the activity and less likely to 
really try their best. 

56
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:35,420
But for now, it's sufficient to say 
rewards are not the same thing as fun. 

57
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,670
I described different theories of what 
fun is. 

58
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,110
And most of them included things other 
than getting some reward. 

59
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,638
Fun can be about interacting wtih 
friends. 

60
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:49,418
It can be about blowing off steam, it can 
be about solving problems, it can be 

61
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:53,620
about exploration. 
Many different things can be fun. 

62
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,622
The fact that you received a reward does 
not necessarily mean that that experience 

63
00:03:57,622 --> 00:04:00,996
is fun. 
And the fact that the experience is fun 

64
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:04,590
doesn't necessarily mean that there's 
some reward in it somewhere. 

65
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,418
And while rewards are not a requirement 
for the PBL kind of approach to 

66
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:12,157
gamification. 
They tend to be a dissenter of those 

67
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:15,384
kinds of implementations. 
And that's a flaw. 

68
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:18,594
Again, the rewards themselves are not 
necessarily wrong. 

69
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:22,951
But if they're the only thing that the 
designer focuses on is the objective. 

70
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:26,485
Then there is a great danger that the 
system will not actually generate the 

71
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:29,896
true results which come from real 
engagement. 

72
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:34,50
And finally if you have points, badges 
and leader boards in your site. 

73
00:04:34,50 --> 00:04:38,3
And that's the heart of it it's likely to 
look somewhat like every other site that 

74
00:04:38,3 --> 00:04:42,680
has points, badges and leader boards. 
And that causes two problems. 

75
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,330
One is. 
Users don't necessarily differentiate. 

76
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,320
And the second is users get burned out. 
They say, Wow. 

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,475
I just went through collecting all these 
badges in this other site. 

78
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:56,220
Why do I have to start from scratch and 
collect these badges here on this site? 

79
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,665
It's not fun, even though the first time 
I experienced it, I thought it was cool 

80
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:05,162
and it attracted me to play more. 
So a couple of common problems with In 

81
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:10,690
particular, too much focus on PBLs in 
gamification. 

82
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,528
There are a variety of other reasons to 
not stop with game elements. 

83
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:19,856
And let me give you one example here. 
And this comes from Google, which is an 

84
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:23,347
extraordinarily good and successful 
company in many ways. 

85
00:05:23,347 --> 00:05:26,421
But here's something that they 
implemented which, to me, has not been 

86
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:30,510
that great a success. 
And it's called Google News Badges. 

87
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,536
So Google in the summer of 2011 announced 
that they would add a gamification 

88
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:38,140
feature to Google News. 
Hey, everyone's doing it. 

89
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,920
And so what they said was as you surf 
around and read news articles in Google 

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,705
News. 
Depending on the subject area of what you 

91
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:54,458
read, you would get these badges. 
This is a basketball badge because I read 

92
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,680
a bunch of articles about basketball. 
And these just pop up. 

93
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,105
There's not a Google News Badges site you 
go to. 

94
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:04,590
You just find them, suddenly you read a 
bunch of basketball articles. 

95
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,900
And Google has a whole bunch of reasons 
why this is good for you. 

96
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,930
It's a way of track of what you're 
reading. 

97
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,230
It's a way of showing people what you're 
reading. 

98
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,860
It's a way of showing things to your 
friends. 

99
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,280
It's a way of getting some data about how 
many articles you've read in a certain 

100
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,80
compared to everyone else. 
But none of these to me seem terribly 

101
00:06:26,80 --> 00:06:28,525
compelling. 
If I like reading articles about 

102
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:31,450
basketball I don't necessarily need the 
news badge to tell me I've read a bunch 

103
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,230
of articles about basketball and even if 
it does. 

104
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,815
So what? 
The badges also are not really giving me 

105
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,760
any kind of reward or achievement. 
They're just there. 

106
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,205
They're looking like the kind of PBL 
badges that recognize some 

107
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,938
accomplishment. 
But here the accomplishment is just I 

108
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:54,0
happened to read a bunch of articles on 
the same topic. 

109
00:06:54,0 --> 00:06:57,670
So it's not clear to me how Google News 
Badges. 

110
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,465
Truly motivates and engages Google news 
readers to do anything that they wouldn't 

111
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:04,990
already do. 
And indeed Google recently announced that 

112
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,590
it had gotten rid of the News Badges 
feature entirely. 

113
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,574
So what went wrong? 
It seems like they saw the appeal of 

114
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:16,260
gamification and just thought they would 
try it out in this way. 

115
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,940
And that's dangerous, because it leads 
you to put things into sites that don't 

116
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,110
have a direct connection to driving real 
business value. 

117
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,260
And when I get to the design section, 
I'll talk about how to think about those 

118
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,460
kinds of questions first, rather than 
putting in the elements and going from 

119
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,388
there. 
A few more points to drive home, this 

120
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:41,99
concept that the elements. 
Well they may be useful, and they're a 

121
00:07:41,99 --> 00:07:45,522
good starting board for gamification, 
they're not the game itself. 

122
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:48,233
Because, if you just focus on these 
elements. 

123
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:52,290
What about those meaningful choices which 
make something game-like? 

124
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,450
Just deciding to click one time versus 
click a hundred times, or deciding to, 

125
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,730
watch a video over here versus do 
something over here on the site. 

126
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,804
It isn't really a choice that feels 
weighty. 

127
00:08:04,804 --> 00:08:09,156
It feels like it's something that the 
person has to think about and make a good 

128
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,952
choice or a bad choice. 
it's not something that really 

129
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:17,611
necessarily engages the user. 
Similarly, challenges are not necessarily 

130
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:20,296
puzzles. 
So saying that you have to do something 

131
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:25,550
and something that may take more effort. 
So for example, clicking 1000 times takes 

132
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,667
a lot more effort than clicking one time. 
But clicking 1000 times isn't 

133
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:33,620
challenging. 
It's certainly not what we think of as a 

134
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,250
puzzle, something that requires problem 
solving and thought in creativity to 

135
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,990
overcome. 
Now not every game of[UNKNOWN] has those. 

136
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,880
And they're not well suited to every 
single example. 

137
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,240
But if you can create something that 
feels like a puzzle, our brains love 

138
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,676
those things. 
I don't mean just a jigsaw puzzle or 

139
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:55,106
logic puzzle. 
But something that feels like there's 

140
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:58,195
some challenge. 
There's some creativity that you're 

141
00:08:58,195 --> 00:09:01,624
called upon to deploy. 
Is something that's going to be much more 

142
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,214
powerful than something that just 
requires mere effort. 

143
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:09,888
Third, what about mastery? 
The fact that you can get a bunch of 

144
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:14,594
badges and get a bunch of points. 
Is there really a pathway, to true 

145
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:19,330
competence. 
To being an expert at something or not. 

146
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,296
If it's just a staircase for the sake of 
having a staircase. 

147
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,372
It may have some value, it may attract 
people. 

148
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:30,68
But it's not going to be as rich and 
engaging as something that has an 

149
00:09:30,68 --> 00:09:34,261
opportunity to truly master some kind of 
skill. 

150
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,600
Whatever that skill is? 
Community. 

151
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,48
As I talked about a few times. 
Social interactions are tremendously 

152
00:09:41,48 --> 00:09:43,982
powerful in games. 
And often, these PBL type sites have no 

153
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:48,460
notion of interaction with other people. 
You're just going and collecting things 

154
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,650
just for it's own sake. 
And finally, people are different. 

155
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,200
So if there is just one kind of 
structure. 

156
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,196
That gives people a set of tasks to 
overcome. 

157
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:04,29
Is it really going to pull in peope with 
different sorts of motivations. 

158
00:10:04,29 --> 00:10:07,410
People with different sorts of 
conceptions of fun. 

159
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,540
So these are some of the limitations of a 
purely element focused approach. 

160
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,396
I put this whole unit in on game elements 
because they are important. 

161
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:21,220
And you need to understand what they are 
to start down the path of gamification. 

162
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,923
But you can't stop there.
