1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,032
As we saw when examining Tic-Tac-Toe, or
you prefer Noughts and Crosses, there are

2
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:09,084
many different game elements. And if you
look at all of the games that you can

3
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:13,081
think of, you'd find a vast array of
different things you may consider as

4
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:19,035
elements, as templates or design patterns
that can be applied in other games or in

5
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:24,085
gamification. But when we examine
prominent examples of gamification.

6
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:29,048
Including the ones that we've covered in
this class for the most part. Certain

7
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:35,038
elements recur again and again. And most
of them are derived directly from, social

8
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:41,689
games online or from other kinds of online
video games. So I've developed a framework

9
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:46,091
for, gamification elements. These are the
common elements that are found in

10
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:51,085
gamification, and some structure around
the different kinds of those elements.

11
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:56,036
These are not every possible element. Nor
are these the best elements. Nor are these

12
00:00:56,036 --> 00:01:02,164
elements that should be in every example
of gamification. Again the best example is

13
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:06,052
not the one that uses the most elements
it's the one that uses the elements the

14
00:01:06,052 --> 00:01:11,076
most effectively. But this framework
should give you some sense of how the

15
00:01:11,076 --> 00:01:17,428
different kinds of elements or pieces from
games can be applied in different ways and

16
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:22,897
it's a pyramid structure that has three
levels. The three levels being the

17
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:28,683
dynamics on top. The mechanics in the
middle and the components on the bottom.

18
00:01:28,683 --> 00:01:33,539
And I'll describe each of those in some
detail. The one point to make though

19
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:38,687
before I go on is that this is not the
totality. Again this is just the elements.

20
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:45,443
And around the elements is the overall
experience of the game. It's the aspect of

21
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:51,506
the game that's not captured fully by the
elements. It's the whole that's greater

22
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:57,586
than the sum of the parts. And, a critical
part of that experience is the aesthetics

23
00:01:57,586 --> 00:02:05,509
of the game. The visual experience of the
game. The, sound. The other aspects that

24
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:12,577
tie the game together and make it feel
somehow real to the players. All of that

25
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:18,532
is above and beyond the elements, all of
that is certainly extremely important in

26
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:24,137
games and often important in g amifica
tion, but that's the part you have to

27
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:28,610
design creatively based on the
circumstances. What we're going to focus

28
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,465
on here is the generic patterns, the
aspects that can be taken from games and

29
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:38,790
applied to generate specific kinds of
results. And one point to add before I go

30
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,600
into more detail. You may recall Marc
LeBlanc the game designer who developed

31
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,395
the notion of Eight kinds of Fun that I
mentioned in an earlier segment. He also

32
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:54,021
created an influential framework for
understanding all games called the MDA

33
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:59,076
Framework. And MDA stands for Mechanics
Dynamics Aesthetics. So it sounds very

34
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:04,003
much like the framework for gamification
elements I just gave you. There are some

35
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:08,025
simularities although LeBlanc uses those
terms in somewhat different ways. Much of

36
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:11,981
what he calls aesthetics is what we talk
about under the rubric of fun. But

37
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:17,335
LeBlanc's framework has been as they said
very influential in helping designers and

38
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:21,772
theorists conceptualise different aspects
of games and how to create them, so if

39
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:26,016
your interested in finding out more.
Here's a link to a paper that he

40
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:31,840
co-authored that goes into detail on the
MDA framework. So now back to the pyramid

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,273
of game elements. At the top of the
pyramid are the game dynamics. These are

42
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:45,714
the most high level conceptual elements.
In a game or a gamified system. I like to

43
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:51,847
think of them as the grammar. The hidden
structure that, makes the experience

44
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:56,380
somehow cohere and have regular patterns.
They're not. The same thing as the rules.

45
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:02,294
The rules are specific to any game. The
rules in Tic-Tac-Toe are you put your x

46
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:07,213
and they put their o and there is a
certain place that you can put them, and

47
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:13,254
so on and so forth. The dynamics are the
implicit structure which the rules, maybe

48
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:19,025
a surface manifestation of... But they
also include more conceptual kinds of

49
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:24,208
elements that provide the framing for the
game. So, for example, constraints, every

50
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:29,088
game has some constraints. Because game
create meaningful choices and interesting

51
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:35,033
problems by limiting people's freedom, so
the notion of what constraints can put on

52
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:40,054
users is a n impo rtant dynamic that any
game designer needs to think about.

53
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:46,014
Emotions. Games can produce almost any
emotion you can think of, from joy to

54
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:50,090
sadness to everything in between. The
emotional palette of gamification is

55
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:56,004
typically somewhat more limited, because
we are dealing with real world, non game

56
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:00,086
context, whether those are at work or a
marketing context or something like

57
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:06,071
exercise, where getting someone really
upset or abject sadness are not things

58
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:11,072
that are not going to be valued in that
kind of situation. But there's still are a

59
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:16,661
variety of emotional levers that can be
pulled that can make the experience more

60
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:22,034
rich and certainly the joy. The, the sense
of accomplishment, the emotional

61
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:27,082
reinforcement that pushes people to play
more is important in most examples of

62
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:34,003
gamification. Narrative, the structure
that pulls together the pieces of the game

63
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:39,029
or the gamified system into some coherent
feeling whole. The narrative can be

64
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:46,065
explicit, the story line in a game. Or it
can be implicit and gamification doesn't

65
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:52,074
necessarily have the richness of the
aesthetic experiential aspect of games, to

66
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:58,017
put the work in creating a narrative. It
has to rely upon things like consistent

67
00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:06,815
graphical experiences, creating a sense of
flow, and alluding to certain kinds of

68
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:13,642
practices or certain kinds of story ideas
that may be in players heads. Using those,

69
00:06:13,642 --> 00:06:17,781
again, to tie together the individual
pieces. If there's no sense of narrative,

70
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:23,524
then the risk is that the gameified system
will just be a bunch of abstract stuff.

71
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:29,300
You get these badges. You get these points
but they're totally divorced from any

72
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,392
sense of coherence and relation to the
players life and that tends to limit the

73
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:40,016
effectiveness of gamification.
Progression, so here we are talking about

74
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:47,031
the notion that you start at one place and
you go up along the way until you get to

75
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:54,028
some higher place. Very important aspect
in, really, most examples of gamification,

76
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:58,075
is giving a player a sense that they are
going to had the opportunity to improve,

77
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:03,064
or at least to move from where they
started as oppose d to just doing the same

78
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:07,094
thing over and over and over again.
Progression doesn't necessarily requires,

79
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:12,057
specific examples like levels and points,
but those we see as typical. Game

80
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:18,117
components that get used to instantiate
that dynamic. And finally relationships.

81
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:23,481
People interacting with each-other.
Friends, teammates, opponents. Those

82
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:29,342
general level social dynamics that are
very important to the experience of the

83
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:34,543
game. So those are the dynamics. At the
next level are the game mechanics. These I

84
00:07:34,543 --> 00:07:39,596
like to think of as the verbs of a game or
gamification. The elements that move the

85
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:44,345
action forward. Now with these and the
next set I won't go into detail on every

86
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:48,623
one because there more of them. That's the
notion of the pyramid that we have a few

87
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:53,496
dynamics. A larger number of mechanics and
a big number of components. But let me

88
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:58,481
just highlight a few of them. So things
like challenges. The game sets some

89
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:04,008
objective for you to reach. Chance.
There's some luck involved. Whether it's a

90
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:09,684
role of the dice or some other mechanism
that makes it so the result is random and

91
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:15,130
not entirely based on your activity. Both
cooperation and competition. Their

92
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,387
opposites, but both are valuable game
mechanics. Getting people to work

93
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:24,391
together, as well as to getting people to
compete against each other to have a

94
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:28,872
notion of winning and loosing. Feedback,
I've already talked about many times. Very

95
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:34,901
important for users to be able to see how
they are doing in real time because that

96
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:40,109
powerfully tends to drive them along to go
further. Resource acquisitions, so game

97
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:44,518
give you things, they give you opportunity
to get things in order to move the game

98
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:49,690
forward. Empires and Allies, for example,
let you acquire oil which then you need in

99
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,416
order to build things airplanes. Rewards,
some benefits that you get for some

100
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:58,652
achievement in the game, transactions.
Buying and selling, or exchanging

101
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:02,802
something with other players, or with
what's called a non player character, with

102
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:06,574
some automated character in the game.
Turns we saw with tic tac toe and win

103
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:11,664
states we also saw wi th tic tac toe. T he
state which defines winning the game. So,

104
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:17,870
again, these are various tools that can be
used to figure out how to move the action

105
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:23,645
forward. To get the players in the game to
go to one state to another. And then

106
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:28,786
finally the lowest level, most service
level kinds of game elements, are the game

107
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:34,902
components. Specific examples, specific
ways to do the higher level things that

108
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:40,483
dynamics and mechanics represent. So for
example, achievements, as opposed to just

109
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:46,440
the general notion of the challenge,
giving the players some reward attached to

110
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,376
doing a set of specific things, that's the
achievement. Avatar, showing the players

111
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:57,205
some visual representation of their
character. Badges, we're going to talk

112
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:02,242
more about these in a second. But specific
visual representations of those

113
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:08,173
achievements as well as of the higher
level dynamics in mechanics. Boss fights

114
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:12,932
is familiar if you play games, it may not
be if you don't. This is at the end of a

115
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:18,430
level, the end of some part of the game. A
really hard challenge. A high level

116
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,434
monster that you have to defeat, and it's
typically really hard to do so, in order

117
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:28,337
to get to the next level. Collections is
pulling together a bunch of different

118
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:33,127
things. Assembling certain pieces or
certain examples of something. You have to

119
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:37,350
get a whole bunch of spells together. Or,
you have to get a whole bunch of badges

120
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,798
together. To fill up a cabinet that you
get in the game. Combat is probably

121
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:46,803
familiar. Content unlocking means you need
to do something. Maybe an achievement.

122
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:51,994
Maybe some leveling up in order to get
access to certain new content in the game.

123
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:57,737
Gifting altruism. Giving things to other
people can actually make people want to

124
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:01,725
play the game more because it feels like
fun. People feel good about giving to

125
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:06,629
others. Leader boards I'll talk about
more. But, lists the players in order of

126
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:11,630
their score. Levels and points. Should be
fairly obvious but again I'll talk about

127
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,828
them more in a second. Eh. Quests are
similar to achievements. This is more the

128
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:20,345
kind of game-like notion that you have to
do some things that somehow a re

129
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:25,658
specifically defined within the structure
of the game. The social graph. We saw this

130
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:29,996
in Empires and Allies as well as at the
bottom in the Kias example. Seeing your

131
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:35,457
friends who are also in the game. And
allowing you to interact with them, to

132
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:39,524
play with and against them. Making the
game an extension of your social

133
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:44,422
networking experience. Teams, I already
talked about. Virtual goods. This we'll

134
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:49,357
see more of later on in the course, but
things within the game. Something that you

135
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:55,025
pick up, the powerful sword or the new
kind of house that you put on your

136
00:11:55,025 --> 00:12:00,019
property in Zenga CityVille. Things that
are virtual, that are not real, but that

137
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,038
users are willing to pay either the
virtual currency of the game or the time

138
00:12:05,038 --> 00:12:11,387
or even real money to get. So altogether
30 different game elements that have given

139
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:15,913
you. Again, not a universal comprehensive
list, but it should show you some of the

140
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:21,354
richness, some of the options that you
have to play with in implementing some

141
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:26,437
gamified system. And the structure of the
pyramid shows, first of all, that it goes

142
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:32,029
from narrow at top to broad at bottom. So
there are fewer dynamics than there are

143
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:38,065
components. But it also shows how the
lower level of examples, the points are

144
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:45,011
examples of things higher up. They are
examples of progression, and they may also

145
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:52,013
be examples of say, meritive. The lower
level examples are ways to do some of the

146
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:56,075
higher level things. That's how the
structure fits together.
