1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,732
To conclude the class I want to focus on
the future.

2
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:09,763
I've spent a great deal of time giving you
the history and roots of gamification as

3
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:13,783
well as the current state of the art and
best practices.

4
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:18,521
So where's it all going?
What's gamification's going to be like in

5
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:22,900
two or five or ten or twenty years?
What does the future hold?

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,784
I don't know.
No one knows for certainty.

7
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:30,226
Gamification is still a fairly young field
that's changing very fast even month by

8
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:32,848
month.
So it would be foolish of me to say I know

9
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:36,220
exactly what the landscape is going to
look like in the future.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,753
But it's still worth thinking about where
things are going.

11
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:46,480
And the best way I can conceive of to do
that is to ask you to imagine what would

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,137
happen if gamification continued to grow
and expand and become more important to

13
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:55,420
the point it truly became pervasive in
society.

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,372
What would that mean.
What would it be like, and what would it

15
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:02,100
say about the practice of gamification
that might teach us lessons for today.

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,678
Well, the best way I can think of to get
you thinking about those questions is to

17
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:13,187
show you a short film called Sight that
was made by two Israeli filmmakers, Eran

18
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:17,663
May-raz and Daniel Lazo.
They actually did it as their graduation

19
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:20,625
project from a leading Israeli film
school.

20
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:26,409
And this video, which several people have
already pointed out on the forums and have

21
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:32,057
had some discussions about is the best
example that I've seen so far to press you

22
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:36,799
to think about What gamification could
mean if it truly became universal?

23
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,724
And so I'm going to, with the permission
of the filmmakers, have you watch the

24
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:44,858
video now.
If you've already seen it you can feel

25
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:48,312
free to skip through it in this video
lecture section.

26
00:01:48,312 --> 00:01:52,196
But, keep in mind.
The film will be the basis of several of

27
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:57,108
the questions on your final exam.
So you might want to look at it before

28
00:01:57,108 --> 00:02:01,760
during taking that as well.
So without further ado, Sight.

29
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:36,313
Excellent.
.

30
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:38,980
Perfect.
.

31
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:48,195
Good job.
Excellent.

32
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:56,527
Well done.
Level complete.

33
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:47,710
, Welcome, .
.

34
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:57,840
Snail zombies, from your, backyard.
Life is a journey.

35
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:07,971
And in this journey, we all want to do
more, experience more, feel more, and

36
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:14,216
live, with no boundaries.
And why shouldn't we?

37
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:21,710
Sight System presents, SiteSync.
Feel free, to go anywhere.

38
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:35,216
Okay, got you.
Oh, hi, hi, Daphne how are you?

39
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:39,641
Sorry.
It's okay.

40
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,860
You look great.
Thank you.

41
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:55,710
Love your jacket.
Thanks.

42
00:04:55,943 --> 00:05:01,467
Actually it's, it's a sports jacket.
So that's official than it looks.

43
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,723
What do you mean?
Sorry.

44
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:08,858
What's the difference between a sports
jacket and a normal one?

45
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:15,627
I guess the sports jacket is for people
who want to look good even when they are

46
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:18,506
chased by the police.
[laugh] Yeah.

47
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:21,540
Anyway I hope you're hungry.
Yeah.

48
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:27,375
This place has the best burgers in town.
Oh, actually I'm a vegetarian.

49
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:28,465
Oh.
Yeah.

50
00:05:28,698 --> 00:05:33,460
Really cause.
You didn't say it on your profiles though.

51
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,543
Wow, I don't write everything on my
profile, so.

52
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:40,543
Oh.
You want to go somewhere else?

53
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:44,210
No, no, no, I'll find something on the
menu.

54
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,126
Well how about a glass of wine for
starters?

55
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:53,126
Yeah, great.
Are there any other things on your profile

56
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:56,876
you didn't write about that I should know
or?

57
00:05:57,126 --> 00:06:01,543
Aren't you scared of jogging by yourself
in the city?

58
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:03,710
Not really.
Besides I'm?

59
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:08,223
I hit level five and now I'm a master.
Pretty impressive.

60
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:12,155
I know.
[laugh] what is scarey though, on my last

61
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:14,994
route, my site crashed.
It was so scarey.

62
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:18,635
I didn't see anything, I couldn't find my
way home.

63
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:21,620
The site doesn't crash.
Well it did.

64
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,605
I was totally lost.
I didn't see anything.

65
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:30,211
That doesn't happen since our last pack.
Do you work there or something?

66
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:31,011
Really?
Wow!

67
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:35,234
What do you do there?
Nothing serious, I'm just a simple

68
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:37,710
engineer.
Gee, I read about your.

69
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:45,703
Is it true that you guys and implant stuff
and manipulate people sights?

70
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:56,362
[laugh] That's just bullshit, but anyway I
don't want to talk about work, not when

71
00:06:56,362 --> 00:07:04,782
I'm here with such a pretty lady.
[laugh] You know you really get me.

72
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:10,644
You know I can tell what you are thinking
right now.

73
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,837
Really.
But.

74
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:25,084
Well finished our drinks.
[laugh] How about we go to my place for a

75
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:33,785
night cap.
Well, you were so good at reading my mind,

76
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:42,164
you should know what I'm going to say.
Here it is.

77
00:07:42,164 --> 00:07:48,120
Make yourself at home.
.

78
00:07:48,777 --> 00:08:00,389
Nice place you've got here.
It's all right I guess.

79
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:05,126
A toast.
For perfect night.

80
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:11,626
.
Why are you drinking?

81
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:14,480
What's that?
A dating app?

82
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,456
No, no, no, no.
It's for programming.

83
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:24,776
I cannot believe this.
This is just my luck, a freaking game

84
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:26,611
junkie.
Disgusting.

85
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:27,937
Wait.
Wait.

86
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:31,810
Do not touch me, you freak.
Pathetic.

87
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:39,816
I said, wait.
.

88
00:08:39,816 --> 00:09:07,340
Well let's try this again.
.

89
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:44,820
