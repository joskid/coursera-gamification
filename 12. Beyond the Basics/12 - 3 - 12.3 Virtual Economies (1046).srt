1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,512
What happens when we add money or things
that work like money to a gamified system?

2
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:10,043
Then we're in a realm of virtual
economics.

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:14,830
And it's possible to get there in a number
of different ways..

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,426
Many gamified systems have rewards,
Things that the players get.

5
00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:22,621
And their often virtual rewards, things
like badges.

6
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:27,382
Well, if those rewards are persistent, if
their things that endure throughout

7
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:31,830
participating in the activities,
Especially if the player goes away and

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,964
comes back,
Then, they can start to function as

9
00:00:34,964 --> 00:00:40,482
virtual goods. If the system is designed
in a way that gives them some scarcity

10
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:43,415
value,
Some of them are harder to get than

11
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:48,793
others, some of them are less widely
available than others, then those virtual

12
00:00:48,793 --> 00:00:54,241
goods can appear to have value to the
players just like a real world physical

13
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:57,332
good does.
The second way to bring in virtual

14
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:02,528
economics is to have point systems that
involve points that are tradable or

15
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:06,493
redeemable i.e.,
You can get the points and use them to buy

16
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:11,552
a variety of different things in the
gamified system, which themselves are

17
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:17,568
virtual goods then. Or you can redeem the
points for things in the physical world,

18
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,191
for a coupon or even for money in the
physical world.

19
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:25,293
In that case we're starting to deal with a
virtual currency.

20
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:29,425
The points now operate like real money.
They're a currency.

21
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:34,823
They're a medium of exchange.
What is a dollar or a euro or a renminbi?

22
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:40,608
It's not a thing in and of itself.
It's just an accounting mechanism that's

23
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,932
tradeable for other real world things that
we want because people in that society

24
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:52,360
with the backing of governments are
willing to make that exchange. And say, if

25
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,756
you give me a certain amount of money, I
will recognize it and give you some other

26
00:01:57,756 --> 00:02:01,309
kinds of goods.
So, the same thing can be true, of, point

27
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:05,915
systems in gamified systems.
If they are, exchangeable for other things

28
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:09,600
that people value, then they can operate
like a currency.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,004
And finally, if the system allows
transactions, if participants in the

30
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:19,303
virtual system can trade with each other
directly or through some marketplace, then

31
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:23,325
potentially we're in the realm of a
full-blown virtual economy.

32
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:27,858
And we've seen this in a variety of
massively multiplayer online games.

33
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:32,965
Things like EVE Online, as well as some
virtual worlds like Second Life that are

34
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:35,965
designed to have functioning virtual
economies.

35
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:40,690
And all these can exist to a greater or
lesser extent in gamified systems.

36
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:47,343
So, a couple of examples, virtual goods
are a widespread phenomenon in many social

37
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:50,300
games today.
So games like Farmville.

38
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,417
One of the ways that they were so
successful as businesses, was they

39
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:59,139
recognized that virtual goods could be
unlocked as a way to monetize the game.

40
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,922
Doesn't cost anything to play, but in
order to achieve certain things easily in

41
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:08,706
the game, or to get certain rare goods in
the game, you've got to start to spend

42
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:11,915
real money.
So people think of those virtual goods as

43
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:16,274
being really worth something, either
because they had to pay for them or

44
00:03:16,274 --> 00:03:19,120
because they had to work very hard to get
them.

45
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,246
This has been so successful that overall
the virtual goods market is estimated at

46
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:29,990
$7,000,000,000 world-wide in 2010, growing
to $13,000,000,000 by 2016.

47
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,310
But it's not just games.
Gamified systems can have aspects of

48
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,904
virtual goods and virtual currencies and,
potentially, even virtual economies as

49
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,020
well.
Think, in particular, about the gamified

50
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,348
systems that are derived from loyalty
programs.

51
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:51,710
So here's an example that I picked out.
Almost at random from Nescafe Australia,

52
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,001
it's something called Cup Of Rewards.
Typical loyalty type program.

53
00:03:56,001 --> 00:04:01,267
You get points for going to the site and
putting in a code because you've bought

54
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:05,688
certain Nescafe products.
And you accumulate the points and then you

55
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:10,954
can exchange them for discounts and for
coupons to use on various other sorts of

56
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:13,230
products.
That's a virtual currency.

57
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,967
It's making those points tradeable and
redeemable for real world benefits, and

58
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:26,360
therefore, it works like a virtual good or
like a currency in another case.

59
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,909
The issue with a lot of these virtual
currencies though, as with many other

60
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:35,520
examples of gamefication in many other
examples of loyalty programs, is that

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,917
they're typically not built today with the
focus on fun.

62
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:42,739
With the focus on the design aspects of
effective gamification.

63
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:47,774
They assume that just the fact that you
can redeem these points for tangible goods

64
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:52,627
will be enough to motivate you to come
back and participate, and buy the desired

65
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,600
products.
But, as we've seen throughout this class.

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,317
Tangible rewards have serious limitations.
And to the extent that a virtual currency

67
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:06,286
is just a way to harness a gamified system
to tangible extrinsic rewards.

68
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:10,234
It has all the limitations that I've
already talked about,

69
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:15,543
B\ut it doesn't have to be that way.
These systems can be designed in ways that

70
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:21,057
focus on fun and that systematically are
designed to unlock intrinsic motivation

71
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:25,890
and that can also feed into the virtual
economic aspects of the system.

72
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:32,679
If designed well, these systems can have
the attributes of both gamification and

73
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:36,329
economics,
So, what does it take to design a

74
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:39,300
successful virtual economy?
The key.

75
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,717
Skill is balance.
I've talked about balance as one of the

76
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:47,831
attributes of game design.
It's ensuring the game is not too hard,

77
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:51,312
too easy, too fast, too slow, one side
doesn't always win.

78
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:55,680
But balance is also critical in economics,
because economics is about,

79
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,618
Not necessarily money, it's about
scarcity.

80
00:05:58,618 --> 00:06:03,654
Anytime there is scarcity, people make
choices under those conditions of

81
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:08,621
scarcity, they will tend to exhibit
economic behavior. And scarcity is a

82
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:13,867
variable in a gamefied system that's
defined, at least at some level,3 by the

83
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:19,534
designe. And in any syste, where people
have the ability to use virtual goods or

84
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:24,920
virtual currencies, it's important to
ensure that there is the right level of

85
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,932
scarcity.
The designer has to constantly balance to

86
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:32,470
ensure that there's not too much money,
which leads to inflation and effectively

87
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,930
devalues the currency, or too little,
which is too hard to get.

88
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,986
This is a process that can be called using
faucets and drains.

89
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:45,808
Faucets are things that put money into the
economy and drains are things that take it

90
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:49,668
out of the economy.
I guess if its a drain then I should

91
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:53,593
probably draw it this way, as you're going
down the drain.

92
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:58,434
But there are ways of balancing how much
money there is in the economy.

93
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:02,556
They can also be called and sometimes are,
sources and sinks.

94
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:06,186
The design technique is to ensure that the
balance is right.

95
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:10,467
If you've got too much money in the
system, it won't be good or too little.

96
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:14,807
Recall when I talked about the game
Monopoly, that when you pass go, you get

97
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:17,179
$200.
That's putting money into the system.

98
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:21,229
When you want to buy houses and hotels,
which are very valuable things,

99
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:24,758
You have to pay money, and that takes
money out of the system.

100
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:29,502
And this is something that effective game
designers building games around virtual

101
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:33,090
economies have learned to do.
For example, in World of Warcraft,

102
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,221
Way back at the beginning of the class I
showed you a little snippet of my

103
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:41,407
character, and at the end of that clip, he
turned into a dragon and flew away.

104
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:45,483
Well, that dragon, something called the
Sandstone Drake, is something that's

105
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:50,000
pretty hard to get in World of Warcraft or
at least it was when it first came out.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,350
But that's also, once you have the ability
to make it, really expensive to make.

107
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,041
And the reason is that, the designers of
the game were trying to balance with this

108
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,844
and other things the level of money in the
world.

109
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:06,420
And by creating something that's really
desirable, because it's rare and hard to

110
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,825
get, and therefore high-level players.
Ones you typically have a lot money are

111
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:15,627
going to try and get it and making that
thing really expensive, they create a way

112
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:19,970
of taking money out of the economy.
And therefore, ensuring that people don't

113
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,370
just get richer and richer to the point
where the system goes out of balance.

114
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,370
So, building a gamified system is about
ensuring than level of balance,

115
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,941
Wanting people to be incentivized to take
money out of the economy in the right

116
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:36,770
times and the right amounts,
And also putting enough money into the

117
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,770
economy so, things don't get too expensive
and too hard to purchase.

118
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,163
The final point I'll make is that there is
some real dangers in building these

119
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:48,890
virtual economies, even though they have
lots of potential benefits.

120
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:54,016
We're talking about systems that may
involve real money or real tangible goods

121
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:58,623
as rewards and those are costly.
And, so, organizations setting up gamified

122
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:04,138
systems that have these attributes need to
make sure that they understand what kinds

123
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:08,486
of obligations they're taking on.
Secondly, they tend to be tangible

124
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:12,249
extrinsic rewards.
So all the concepts that I talked about

125
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:15,040
earlier, about the hedonic treadmill
effect,

126
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,877
Where rewards start to become less and
less desirable and the crowding out

127
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:25,174
effect, where people actually become less
motivated for the activity itself, because

128
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:30,532
they think it's so tied up in the reward.
All that's very relevant and an important

129
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:35,438
caution to think about when building
systems that have virtual economics in

130
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:38,472
them.
You don't wanna build a system that falls

131
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:43,443
into the trap of these tangible extrinsic
rewards, demotivating the enjoyable

132
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:46,541
behaviour.
In order to ensure that the intrinsic

133
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:50,686
motivation is still there,
It's important to think about, the

134
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:55,038
scarcity and rarity and surprise value of
the virtual goods.

135
00:09:55,038 --> 00:10:00,987
If something feels cool, not necessarily,
because it's valuable in a tangible sense,

136
00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:06,427
but because it's something that's
difficult to achieve, like that dragon in

137
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:11,578
World of Warcraf or it's really
interesting, and, looks great within in

138
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:15,884
the gamified system.
That might be something that still feels

139
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:20,932
valuable to the players, even though, or
basically, independent of the tangible

140
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:25,062
value associated with it.
So, there's much more that I could say

141
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:29,847
about designing virtual economies.
I wanted to put this unit in though, just

142
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:34,633
to ensure that you think about the
potential of this as one technique to
