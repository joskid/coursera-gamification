1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,747
Gameification can be a very powerful
technique for collective action.

2
00:00:04,747 --> 00:00:10,054
For motivating and encouraging large
numbers of people to come together, and

3
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:15,709
work on a common task or a set of tasks.
I already talked about something related

4
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:21,225
to this when I described stack overflow.
And showed how the Gameification design

5
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:26,602
for that site encouraged pro-social, and,
in some cases, collaborative behavior,

6
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:31,070
like people commenting and responding on
each others questions.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,979
But,
What if you have a specific objective?

8
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:39,445
Stack Overflow is designed to be a forum
for people learning about and getting

9
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:43,804
better at programming.
What if you have a task that you want to

10
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:49,546
solve, and you want to employ the energy
and ideas and enthusiasm of a large number

11
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:53,905
of people towards it?
There are a number of different scenarios

12
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:58,403
where this might be the case.
Some of them, we've actually already

13
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:01,447
looked at.
So, let me give you a framework to

14
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:06,920
understand what I'm talking about.
I'll draw two axis here.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,840
One of them will say is competitive versus
collaborative.

16
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:22,118
In other words, are people working
together with each other or against each

17
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:28,626
other in trying to achieve the task.
And the other one would be top down versus

18
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:33,030
bottom up.
Traditionally, the way people are

19
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,577
motivated and encouraged to do things is
top down.

20
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:42,253
Someone says, this is what you will do.
The alternative approach is to do it in a

21
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:47,290
more bottom up way by getting them to be
motivated to do it themselves.

22
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,581
So in this first quadrant here.
Competitive top down, this would be

23
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:54,451
grants.
So this is where, a company or foundation

24
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:59,232
or organization says we want to find
someone who's going to do a certain amount

25
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:02,639
of research to achieve something or get a
certain result.

26
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:06,285
And so we'll pick a winner and then give
them the money to do it.

27
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:10,763
The alternative approach.
That's bottom up, was described in one of

28
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:14,462
the earlier sessions.
That's where we would put the inducement

29
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:20,049
prizes.
Still competitive.

30
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:25,203
People or organizations or groups are
competing to win the prize, but now it's

31
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:28,507
bottom up.
Anyone can submit to the prize and the

32
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:34,256
organization only pays out to the winner.
Here on the collaborative side is what I'm

33
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:39,279
going to talk about more in this lecture.
The traditional approach is to use

34
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:42,988
employees.
So if you want a group of people to work

35
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:46,207
together to solve a problem you tell them
to do it.

36
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,680
The alternative though is what's called
crowd sourcing.

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:59,818
Or in some cases, make it work.
This is a family of approaches that

38
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:05,750
encourage people to come together to
either collaborate with each other or to

39
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,770
each take a small part or a small amount
of effort towards a task.

40
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,902
But the people are not workers for the
entity that puts forth the task, there are

41
00:03:16,902 --> 00:03:23,174
people who are motivated through a bunch
of different mechanisms that I'm about to

42
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:26,423
talk about, voluntarily to take on the
task.

43
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:29,603
So.
What is it that might motivate people to

44
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:32,916
take on a task if it's not for their
employer.

45
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:37,887
Well, one thing is, of course, money.
So there are a number of platforms,

46
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:43,794
Amazon's Mechanical Turk which I'm showing
you here is the biggest and best known,

47
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:49,340
which provide an environment for this
collaborative crowd-sourced micro-work.

48
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,815
For people to voluntarily work on certain
tasks, typically for money, it doesn't

49
00:03:54,815 --> 00:04:00,650
have to be for money but typically, these
are situations where a company wants

50
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,510
something done.
They want someone to go check out a bunch

51
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,422
of websites, or review a bunch of
documents.

52
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:11,930
Do some sort of tasks that requires some
level of human intelligence.

53
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,100
Amazon,
Calls them here human intelligence tasks,

54
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,612
you may not be able to see it on the
graph, it goes a little small, but they're

55
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:22,124
tasks that can't easily be done by a
computer because if they could easily be

56
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:24,992
done by a computer.
We just have a computer do that.

57
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:30,148
The computers are a lot cheaper and faster
than people, but lots of things require

58
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:34,046
some degree of thought and discrimination
that humans do well.

59
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:39,139
So mechanical turk, and other things like
it, are platforms for people to come and

60
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,358
do those tasks, and typically they get
paid a small amount for doing it and this

61
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:48,634
has been quite successful.
As you see here, there are over 200,000 of

62
00:04:48,634 --> 00:04:51,590
these tasks available today on mechanical
turk.

63
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,478
So, this is one form of crowd sourcing,
but as I talked about throughout the

64
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:02,816
class, money is not necessarily the only
thing that motivates people.

65
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:09,333
So is it possible to motivate people to
participate in these crowd source projects

66
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,572
without necessarily paying them to do it?
Indeed it is.

67
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:18,832
And the way to do it is, to use
Gameification Let me show you a few

68
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:22,130
examples.
This is something called Fold It.

69
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:28,220
I didn't put the OL on here but it's just
that fold that.

70
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,159
It Fold it.
This is a site that was developed by some

71
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:39,357
biomedical researchers at the University
of Washington, and they are working on 3D

72
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:43,388
protein folding.
It turns out that the three dimensional

73
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:48,475
shape that a protein molecule folds up
into has a tremendous impact on what it

74
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:52,145
does in the body.
So if we know the 3-D shape we are much

75
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:57,554
further along in developing drugs based on
those proteins and those other molecules.

76
00:05:57,554 --> 00:06:02,254
But it's incredibly, computationally
difficult to figure out what shape a

77
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:05,500
molecule will fold into.
However,

78
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,122
People are really good at figuring this
out, because it's a puzzle.

79
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:15,724
It's something that involves looking at
the shapes and figuring out the most

80
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:20,556
efficient configuration.
And so Fold It is a game like system that

81
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:26,229
gives you some real world proteins and
asks you to figure out the most efficient

82
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,273
layout.
And by making this process game-like.

83
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:33,828
By making it seem like fun, these
researchers were able to motivate

84
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:38,858
thousands of people to come together and
work on these problems with some

85
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:42,937
tremendous success.
So, there was a case in which there was a

86
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:48,171
molecule that's important for AIDS
research, has to do with a monkey virus

87
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:52,521
that's similar to AIDS.
Where for fifteen years researchers have

88
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:57,416
been trying to figure out the 3D fold,
folding shape of that melocule.

89
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,917
And unfolded,
Volunteers were able to figure it out in

90
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:05,577
just ten days, incredible success and they
had another a number of other examples

91
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:10,428
like that, where this aspect of making
something feel fun or puzzle-like, and

92
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:15,343
also telling people that it's part of
helping medical research, it has been very

93
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:19,939
successful with motivating participation,
which had got in a great results.

94
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:25,238
Now, the funny thing is a lot of the press
that came out after this development was

95
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:30,031
announced, involving the monkey virus,
talked about video gamers solving the

96
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:33,297
problem.
Online gamers were the ones who had solved

97
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:37,076
the puzzle and, and cracked the, medical
research problem.

98
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:42,329
And I thought that was kind of ironic
because these people were gamers only in

99
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:46,799
the sense that Fold It was a game.
It wasn't that Fold It deliberately

100
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:51,394
recruited only people who actively played
certain kinds of online games.

101
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:55,606
They were gamers because they were using a
site that was gamified.

102
00:07:55,606 --> 00:08:00,839
Fold It is a very good example but there
are a number of other examples like this

103
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,634
where applying game like structures can
encourage voluntary participation in

104
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:09,557
crowd-sourced activities.
Here's another one from a company called

105
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:14,432
Microtask in Finland, where they partnered
with the Finnish National Library, which

106
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:19,365
was trying to digitize, major, historical
works in Finnish, and they needed people

107
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,991
to, review and proofread, the optical
character recognition.

108
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:27,211
So, they created this thing called
Digitalkoot, that is basically a game,

109
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:31,313
where you play these, creatures, I don't
really know what these are.

110
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:36,425
But, and they're building a bridge across
the river and the component pieces of the

111
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:40,332
bridge are words that have been
interpreted by the optical character

112
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:43,401
recognition system.
And you need to see if the words are

113
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:48,985
correct,
And you use this game to feed in your work

114
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:55,231
to the process of checking the
digitization of the finished works, and

115
00:08:55,231 --> 00:09:01,590
they were able through this process to,
get a huge number of people to participate

116
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:07,505
and to review 2.5 million specific
examples in this digitization process.

117
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:12,772
Again, not by paying people, but by
encouraging them by making it fun.

118
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:16,867
Now Microtask,
Also has a business that uses the same

119
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:20,768
game like interfaces in environments where
they do pay people.

120
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:26,203
The game then just encourages and
increases the level of motivation and then

121
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:32,264
they go out to paying clients who want to
do thing like form processing who want to

122
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:37,977
understand optical character recognition
of handwritten forms and you are willing

123
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,949
to pay an amount of money to Microtask
which then could pay a little bit to each

124
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:45,990
of the participants.
And the company gets back much better

125
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,284
results on the quality of their forms.
The Gameification there becomes not the

126
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:54,497
only for a motivation but something that
dramatically increases the level of

127
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:57,070
motivation and gets more people to
participate.

128
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,789
In some cases, crowd sourcing and micro
work can be done without people even fully

129
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:05,928
understanding that that's what they're
doing.

130
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:11,299
Luis Von Ahn is a researcher at Carnegie
Mellon University who is one of the

131
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:15,275
leaders in developing what he calls games
with a purpose.

132
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:20,715
One of the ones that he originally
developed was this example here called the

133
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:25,249
ESP game, which is a cute little game that
shows people a picture.

134
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,880
Here we see a bunch of sheep and says,
What is this?

135
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,539
Type in what this is and the same thing is
given to two different people so you type

136
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,687
in here what you think it is and the
system says did you and the other person

137
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:40,810
type in the same word?
Because if two people looking an image

138
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,395
type in the same word, there's a pretty
high likelihood that, that word

139
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:47,825
corresponds to the image.
Conversely if people type in different

140
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:51,819
things, then maybe those are not right and
that provides some more data to the

141
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,458
system.
What's the point of this?

142
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,554
Well it's kinda fun for the players to
figure out if you're matching with other

143
00:10:57,554 --> 00:11:01,753
people, if you get the right description
of something and in fact they got lots of

144
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:05,064
people to participate.
And then, and try and get a high score,

145
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,850
and engage in it in the same way that I've
talked about for other examples of

146
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,878
Gameification The point of this though for
the company setting this up, is improving

147
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:16,262
image search.
Very hard for a computer to look at this

148
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:21,231
and know that this is sheep.
We've got lots of great research on visual

149
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:26,602
recognition and computer vision, but it's
still not as good as a person doing it.

150
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:32,108
So, this is a way of improving the quality
of image search and meta-tagging images

151
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,190
for search engines.
And in fact.

152
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,298
Google bought the company, bought the
technology, that von Ahn had developed for

153
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,090
this ESP game in order to improve their
image search.

154
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,514
Now here again, this is not something like
the prior examples, where people are being

155
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:47,727
told, you're participating in image
search.

156
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:51,730
People are just being told, here's
something fun, and they're doing it to the

157
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,732
extent that it's fun.
So Gameification can be used both in

158
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:58,999
situations were people explicitly know
what they're doing or in situations where

159
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:02,949
they're just being encouraged to
participate in some way in what turns out

160
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:06,786
to be a crowdsourced activity.
So, what kinds of situations lend

161
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:10,137
themselves?
Well, well, there need to be tasks that

162
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:13,724
can be split up easily.
Fairly obvious, it needs to be a task that

163
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:17,916
lot's of people can work on in parallel.
Either that means each person gets a

164
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:22,326
little segment of the task or many people
are simultaneously trying to solve the

165
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,776
task.
And needs to be a task, as I've talked

166
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:27,716
about before.
That people are good at doing because if

167
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:32,072
either it's to hard for people to do or
it's too easy for computers to do those,

168
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:34,576
the people are not the best possible
solution.

169
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:37,680
The second major element is it has to be
something where,

170
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,727
A gamified system is a good motivational
technique.

171
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:45,328
There are three basic ways people can be
motivated to do something crowd-source.

172
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,300
One is for money.
One is for love.

173
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,945
It's something that they care about,
that's important to them.

174
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:54,052
The Finnish library example might be a
good example.

175
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:58,354
That people in that country want to
promote the preservation of Finnish

176
00:12:58,354 --> 00:13:01,521
literature.
Another example was when Jim Gray who was

177
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:05,943
a famous computer science researcher
disappeared on his boat in the ocean.

178
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:10,962
People volunteered to scour satellite maps
to try and figure out if they could find

179
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:14,054
evidence of.
His ship, because they cared a lot about

180
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:18,030
trying to save this guy who was a very
revered figure in the field.

181
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,778
So they did it not for money, or because
the task was fun, but because they cared

182
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:26,280
about the result.
So that's another situation and the third

183
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,791
is people being motivated for fun, and,
and this one is really the one that we're

184
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:35,361
most concerned about in Gameification but
as I talked about with the earlier

185
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:39,693
examples, more than one of these can be
present and the same time, and fun,

186
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:44,620
game-like approaches tend to be something
that can magnify the level of engagement.

187
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,620
Even if it's already there and being
re-enforced by some other mechanism.

188
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,031
So.
Inducement prices, virtual economies,

189
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:58,754
crowd sourcing, are three different
techniques for expanding the scope of

190
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:05,338
Gameification Going beyond dealing with a
specific objective within a company or for

191
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:11,923
company visa-vi it's customer base, and as
I've talked about, they can relate to each

192
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:17,802
other in different ways, but they all rely
upon the same basic motivational

193
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:23,760
techniques and lessons that we've been
seeing throughout this entire course.
