1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,762
There are many mistakes that you can make
in designing a gamified system. But, one

2
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:13,034
of the most common and one of the most
dangerous is to forget about who the

3
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:19,016
object at the system is, namely, the
players. And to forget that players are

4
00:00:19,016 --> 00:00:23,404
people, they're human beings. They're
thinking, and feeling, and interacting

5
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:29,247
agents. And while you can anticipate in
many ways how their going to behave, and

6
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:35,026
certainly anticipate the different kinds
of motivational structures that might push

7
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:39,898
them in one direction or another, you can
never be sure what their going to do. And,

8
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:45,465
in designing gamified systems, it's
critical to recognize that one thing that

9
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:50,662
players may do is game the system. They
may turn the tables on you and do

10
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:55,767
something that you never expected and
never intended. Sometimes this can be

11
00:00:55,767 --> 00:01:01,224
dangerous not just for you, but for them.
Nicole Lazzaro, the game designer who

12
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:06,107
developed the concept of four types of
fun, gives a great example in her

13
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:11,216
presentations, which she calls,
Gamification Can Kill. And the example is

14
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:17,276
the on ramp to the San Francisco Bay
bridge, maybe it's the Golden Gate bridge.

15
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:23,107
But, it's one of the bridges in San
Francisco, California. And like many urban

16
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:29,300
transit systems, they have a system for
pricing that's congestion based. The price

17
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:35,133
goes up during rush hour to try to
encourage people to go across the bridge

18
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:40,687
at less busy times. So you see here at
six:59, I think this must be PM it's six

19
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:45,696
bucks to go over the bridge but it's
seven, a minute later it's only four bucks

20
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:50,017
to go over the bridge. Great, incentive
systems, you call it a gamified system,

21
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:54,636
you can call it behavioral economics. It
suddenly encourages people to drive during

22
00:01:54,636 --> 00:02:00,228
off hours. What's the problem? The problem
as points out, is if you drive towards the

23
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:05,197
bridge at six:59 p.m., you will see a
whole bunch of people swerving off the

24
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:10,429
road. Trying to park on the side because
they know that if they wait just a minute

25
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,984
or two more to go over the bridge it's
$two less. And the problem is what this is

26
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:19,551
incentivizing people to do is to swerve
dangerously off t h e road in ways that

27
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:25,521
might cause them to get in an accident.
And so that's the point about gamification

28
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:30,542
can kill. We have to realize how people
are going to respond to do these systems.

29
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:34,674
They may very well react to the prompts
that are given not necessarily in the ways

30
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:39,768
that are anticipated or even too much in
the way that they, that are, the ways that

31
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:45,091
are anticipated and that could be
dangerous. Now, one dimension of this is a

32
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:50,079
recognition that sometimes people will
cheat. That sometimes people will figure

33
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:55,098
out a way to achieve their own aims in the
system that are not the aims of the game

34
00:02:55,098 --> 00:03:00,079
designer. Maybe there's some flaw in the
game that lets people accumulate vast

35
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:05,061
numbers of points for a small amount of
work. And if that option is there, many

36
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:10,007
people will take it. Now, as I talked
about, part of what makes a game a game is

37
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:14,036
that the players have to voluntarily
accept the rules of the game. That often,

38
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:18,081
there are opportunities to cheat in the
game but we don't do them, because if we

39
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:23,005
do, then we're not following the rules,
we're not playing the game, we're just

40
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:27,039
doing something else entirely. And the
people around us, our opponent, the other

41
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,073
participants, won't even recognize that
we're playing the game. But in gamified

42
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:36,024
systems, where we're dealing with people
interacting with computer based software

43
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:41,018
systems. Often even though they're in a
social context, they're interacting

44
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:46,014
individually, it's often easy for people
to feel like the game that they are

45
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:51,049
playing is one that allows them to. Bend
the rules or make their own rules in ways

46
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:56,267
that the game designer would consider
cheating. Interestingly enough well

47
00:03:56,267 --> 00:04:00,574
designed games that have social elements
tend to see this last because the social

48
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,779
pressure, whether explicit or implicit, is
enough to get people not to cheat even in

49
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:09,106
ways that they could. But even there,
there is the potential if the rewards are

50
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:13,761
great enough or the incentive is great
enough that people may try to tackle

51
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:17,593
corners. And this is something that
depending on the nature of the sys tem

52
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:21,588
maybe the game designer will just live
with, or maybe it's something that the

53
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:26,253
game needs to be expressly built with the
anticipation that people act that way.

54
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:30,651
This is a big reason why iteration and
play testing is so critical in designing

55
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:35,663
games as well as in effective gamification
design because you can never be sure what

56
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:39,972
exactly people are going to do until you
get them in and see them actually doing

57
00:04:39,972 --> 00:04:45,113
it. In some cases though, cheating may be
a virtue. It may actually help achieve the

58
00:04:45,113 --> 00:04:50,352
results that the game designer is thinking
about. How can that be? Well, let me give

59
00:04:50,352 --> 00:04:55,793
you one example. James Gardner is an
innovation designer who now works for a

60
00:04:55,793 --> 00:05:01,645
company called Spigot that makes a
gamified prediction market system that can

61
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:06,389
be used in companies to develop
innovations by creating contests where

62
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,702
people bet real money or virtual goods
that potentially are translatable to real

63
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:16,970
money on new ideas. And, he's been part of
teams that have developed these kinds of

64
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,401
systems in many different context,
originally in England. He famously

65
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:26,586
developed the idea street program at the
Department of Welfare and Pensions in the

66
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:31,093
UK. But before that, he did it for Loyd's
Bank. And something interesting happened

67
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:35,038
at Loyd's Bank where they created the
innovation market. So, this was a market

68
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,238
place where you came up with ideas that
would be helpful innovations for the bank

69
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:43,681
and people could buy and sell those
innovations. And people could get together

70
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:47,928
in teams to develop the innovations and
the market we determine which were the

71
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:52,393
more popular and more successful ones and
then the company would take the more

72
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,460
successful ones and try and implement
them. And they found in this a lot of

73
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,570
cases, lots of amazing results in
implementing the ideas that bubble to the

74
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,022
top through this production market place.
But something interesting happened at

75
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:09,929
Loyd's when they applied this Gamified
System Insider Trading. People realized

76
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:16,082
that they could find the good ideas and go
and join up with those groups and be able

77
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:21,522
to buy and sell with th e ideas that were
rising and successful in the syst 'em. In

78
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:25,880
financial markets, insider trading is a
danger, it's cheating. It's a form of

79
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,508
fraud because it's using information that
you have that other people don't have. It

80
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:34,822
undermines trust in the financial markets,
that's a reason that it's often

81
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:39,201
prosecuted. But in this gamified system,
this kinda virtual insider trading was not

82
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:43,861
a bug but actually a feature. Because it
was a way of strengthening and growing the

83
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:48,476
teams around the great ideas. And it was a
way of reinforcing, providing additional

84
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:53,347
signal value around the ideas that people
thought had great potential which is what

85
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:58,121
the game applied system was about. It was
not about making money for people or

86
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:03,589
making money for companies that were
issuing securities, it was about finding

87
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:09,260
and developing great ideas and reinforcing
them. So, the gaming of the game by the

88
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,549
participants as Gardner realized was
actually something that helped achieve

89
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:21,311
that result. In all of these cases again,
the critical piece is to recognize that

90
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:26,389
people will act in unpredictable,
sometimes spontaneous ways in response to

91
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,256
the signals that the system produces. And
so part of game design is building in

92
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:36,053
structures that first of all, ensure that
those activities, if there aren't

93
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:41,162
anticipated, don't destroy the game. Don't
create imbalances or otherwise make the

94
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:46,062
game unplayable or undesirable for a large
segment of the players. And ideally,

95
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:51,538
create systems so that they help the game.
So that even though people aren't doing

96
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:56,916
what the game designer expressly told them
to, they're exercising their autonomy and

97
00:07:56,916 --> 00:08:01,997
therefore, feeling more intrinsically
motivated in the activity and doing things

98
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:08,032
that get to the same result that the
gamification system was originally

99
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:10,094
designed to accomplish.
