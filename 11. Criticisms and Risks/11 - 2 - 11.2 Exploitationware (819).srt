1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,078
One criticism of gamification is that it's
ineffective, because it only uses the

2
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:11,064
surface mechanics and other elements from
games and thus, should really be called

3
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:17,072
pointification. A second criticism is that
gamification is potentially too effective,

4
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:23,032
that it can be used to get people to do
things that aren't necessarily in their

5
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:28,084
interest. And that criticism goes by the
name of exploitationware. I've already

6
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:34,070
shown you some examples in this vein when
talking about enterprise gamification and

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:40,022
the concept of play board or coerced play.
For example, the leader board for the

8
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:45,025
housekeeping staff at some of the
Disneyland hotels, where the employees

9
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:50,286
felt like the gamefication techniques were
not encouraging and motivating them. In

10
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:55,083
fact, they were controlling and
manipulating them and forcing them to

11
00:00:55,083 --> 00:01:01,058
compete more aggressively just to keep up.
That's an example of gamefication being

12
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:06,098
used in a way that potentially is
exploitative as opposed to encouraging and

13
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:12,064
supportive of the employees. The term
exploitationware was coined by Ian Bogost,

14
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:18,068
who's a noted game designer and researcher
at Georgia Tech University, in a post that

15
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:24,057
appeared on his personal blog and also on
the games industry blog Gamasutra. Here's

16
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:29,294
the URL to the personal blog version of
it. And, he essentially made two

17
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:35,443
arguments. One was that gamification if,
people like, like Margaret Robertson say,

18
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:41,045
it's an inadvertent con, it's accidentally
misleading people about the nature of

19
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:46,092
games. Bogost says, no, actually, it's an
intentional con. Gamification is a way to

20
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:52,012
try to make people think that their job
doesn't suck, even when it does. So,

21
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:59,004
gamefication, he says, is inherently a
technique that can be used as a way to

22
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:05,231
confuse people and to make them ignore the
real conditions of their workplace as

23
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:11,341
opposed to focusing on the actual
compensation and meaningfulness and

24
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:17,784
rewarding aspects of the job. The broader
point though that Bogost makes in calling

25
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:24,765
gamification exploitationware is that it
fundamentally undermines the nature of

26
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:30,343
economic and social exchange between w
orkers and their employers. And his

27
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:36,051
argument goes like this. He says,
gamification proposes to replace real

28
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:42,034
incentives with fictional ones. So, in
other words, if the idea is we can

29
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:47,093
motivate people with shiny badges and
points, and all of these virtual

30
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:53,076
techniques that lead to no tangible
material rewards, then companies will

31
00:02:53,076 --> 00:03:00,047
start to do that instead of rewarding and
incentivizing their employees with things

32
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:05,004
like money, or better working conditions,
or more job responsibility. And his

33
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:09,043
argument is that essentially, this
undermines the bargain between both sides,

34
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:14,004
because the workers are still giving up
their effort and their productivity, but

35
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:18,037
what they're getting in return is
something that is ultimately empty. Maybe

36
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:22,088
for a little bit, they feel like it's
something motivating, but really what the

37
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:27,032
company is doing is again, an intentional
con, is saying, instead of giving you

38
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:32,000
something that we know is valuable to you
and which is costly to us to give, we're

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,366
going to give you something that we think
of as virtually free to basically trick

40
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:40,548
you into thinking that you're getting a
reward that's meaningful. And so, that's

41
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:45,400
the argument about exploitationware and
it's one that is worth taking into

42
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,261
account. Bogost does have a point and, in
fact, there are examples we can see,

43
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:55,049
including some of the ones that I've given
you in the course, where gamification is

44
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:00,507
not necessarily something that's done to
make workers better off. But here, as with

45
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:07,170
many other examples of gamification, the
real question is how are the tools being

46
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,395
used? The same context can be used in
exploitative ways or in ways that are

47
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:18,297
healthy for workers. For example, in the
call center space, there are examples of

48
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:24,348
gamification that are about manipulation,
that are about companies wanting to track,

49
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:30,775
ever more closely, what workers are doing
in order to manage them in ways that don't

50
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:36,417
help the workers at all. They treat them
as commodities and that probably are not

51
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:41,369
ultimately healthy for the companies
themselves because they're so short term

52
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:46,190
focused. And at the same time, there are
examples in the call center world of

53
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,981
gamification systems that encourage people
as call center operators, to learn and to

54
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:56,770
feel more engagement and more meaning in
their work. So, the problem I think, is

55
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,960
not gamification, per se, the problem is
use of gamification, either inadvertently

56
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,274
without an awareness that there can be a
divergence between the players interest

57
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:13,068
and at least a short term version of the
system designers interest. Or deliberately

58
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:18,808
as a trick, as a shortcut to force people
to do something. This is something that's

59
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:23,999
dangerous, that's harmful. And that
gamification designers need to be careful

60
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:28,889
to avoid. But it's something that can
happen easily if you're not careful.

61
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,046
Bogost, himself designed a wonderful proof
of the ease of reaching this conclusion

62
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:38,970
with something he created called Cow
Clicker. And Cow Clicker was something

63
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,074
that Bogost created on a lark. It was
partly a way to make fun of social games

64
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:48,649
like the Zinga games, that are so driven
by virtual goods and virtual currency, and

65
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:53,670
these appointment dynamics of trying to
get people to feel like they're crops are

66
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,511
going to rot so they have to come back
right away. And so, what Bogost did was

67
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:03,543
created something like one of these social
games called Cow Clicker, that had no

68
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:07,916
point whatsoever. The mechanic of the
games was, you have to click on a cow.

69
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:12,367
That's it. You click on the cow, you click
on the cow again, you click on the cow

70
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:17,199
again. But, there are all different kinds
of cows. The cows are virtual goods. So,

71
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,689
there are some cows that are more rare.
There are some cows that you unlock by

72
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:26,489
clicking a lot, or clicking at certain
times. And the game is designed to show at

73
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:31,785
least to Bogost, the fundamental emptiness
of these kinds of systems that rely purely

74
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:37,015
on these engagement loops. And it turns
out what happened was 50,000 plus people

75
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:42,082
started playing this game, which again,
had no point whatsoever other than to show

76
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:46,437
how silly this idea was. People were
actually doing it, people were clicking o

77
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:51,312
n the cows time and time and time again.
And ultimate ly there were people topping

78
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:56,748
the leaderboard with vasts amounts of the
games virtual currency which could only be

79
00:06:56,748 --> 00:07:01,132
accumulated if they had clicked hundreds
of thousands of times on these cows. So,

80
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:05,916
clearly, people do surprising things.
Things that, may at first glance, makes no

81
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:11,922
sense, if they are drawn in by these kinds
of habit forming engagement based system.

82
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:17,112
That's part of what can make them useful,
but it is also what makes them dangerous.

83
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:23,030
So, in designing gamification, the first
step in the process, the first step in the

84
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,036
gamification design framework that I gave
you, is to focus on the business

85
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:33,097
objectives. What's the purpose here?
What's the purpose of encouraging people

86
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:40,032
to take some action? How does it really
tie to a deep important business or other

87
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:46,039
goal? And the second thing is who are the
players. It's critical to focus on the

88
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:51,087
people who were involved in the game and
not to treat them just as automatons that

89
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:57,002
are forced or suckered into participating
this, in this activity, which doesn't

90
00:07:57,002 --> 00:08:02,014
really benefit them. So, exploitation are
like pointsification is a legitimate

91
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:07,026
criticism, is one that's successful and
thoughtful gamification designers need to

92
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:12,539
take into account and is one that should
be part of your thinking whenever you try

93
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:17,061
to understand how to apply these
techniques that I've talked about to a

94
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:19,025
problem that you've defined.
