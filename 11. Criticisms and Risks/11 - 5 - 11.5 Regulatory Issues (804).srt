00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,034
In addition to the legal considerations
about gamification, there are a series of

2
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:10,075
what we might call regulatory concerns.
Areas where some practice might be allowed

3
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:16,010
but it's subject to various restrictions
by administrative and other agencies. So,

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,058
let me go through a few of these quickly.
Most of them like the legal issues become

5
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:26,047
particularly serious when there's money
involved. The first though, doesn't

6
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:31,021
necessarily require that. It's the
situation where someone is surreptitiously

7
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:35,999
becoming a marketer or an endorser for a
product. The Federal Trade Commision in

8
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:41,345
the United States promulgated a set of
rules in the past few years that were

9
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:46,081
primarily targeted at bloggers who were
being given money or free products or

10
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:52,001
other consideration by companies in order
to write wonderful things about those

11
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:56,076
companies on their blogs. Some of them
were people who actually liked the

12
00:00:56,076 --> 00:01:02,015
products and just appreciated getting free
stuff. But in some cases, the people were

13
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:08,019
effectively becoming paid endorsers. And
yet, to the readers of the blog, they were

14
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:13,025
just some person who was writing an
individual blog, and happened to genuinely

15
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:18,025
love these products. So, the Federal Trade
Commission issued rules, essentially

16
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:23,064
requiring disclosure saying, that if you
are endorsing a product in some public way

17
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:28,089
because they gave you something, then you
have to disclose that fact and not have

18
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:33,611
people think that you're endorsing the
product purely because you happen to love

19
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:37,798
it. So, how does this connect with
gamification? Well, one of the ways that

20
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:45,065
many gamefication systems in marketing
provide opportunities for people to get

21
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:51,036
points, is by recommending products or
companies through social media. So, for

22
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:57,383
example, here, this is the Samsung Nation
service, which I've used a number of times

23
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:02,634
before. And one of the badges it has is a
badge that you can unlock here by liking

24
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:09,210
this post. So if you like the post about
Samsung Nation then you unlock a badge.

25
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,007
And there are other badges and
achievements in this and other

26
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:19,035
gamification systems that involve t hings
like twee ting about a company or a

27
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:24,070
product, liking it on Facebook, or posting
something on it on Facebook or elsewhere.

28
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,092
And these are situations that might give
rise to this requirement of disclosure.

29
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:35,031
Now, in these cases, the person involved
is not necessarily getting paid directly.

30
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:40,037
They're just getting some virtual value
through the point system or the

31
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:45,083
achievements in the gamified system, which
itself may or may not produce tangible

32
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:51,023
real rewards. But it's worth thinking
about if this is a key structure in the

33
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:56,062
gamified system whether, at some point, it
might run afoul of some of these rules.

34
00:02:56,062 --> 00:03:03,018
Second concern from the standpoint of
regulation is banking. If in fact, what's

35
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:09,072
involved in the gamified system is a
currency, is something that is like money

36
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:14,080
or that is freely tradable back and forth
with money, then potentially all of the

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,056
kinds of requirements that apply to banks,
things like record keeping, reserve

38
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:24,031
requirements, things about currency
manipulation, fraud, money laundering is a

39
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:29,039
big one, restrictions on taking money in
and out of countries, consumer protection

40
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,008
laws, taxation rules, accounting rules.
All that stuff potentially applies or

41
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:39,003
maybe, you, as the service provider are
not permitted to engage in this activity

42
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:43,072
unless you are registered and regulated as
a bank. So, this is something that

43
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:48,663
typically a gamified system provider or a
company that's using some sort of gamified

44
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:53,672
system, is not going to want to have to
deal with. They're not in this because

45
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:59,749
they want to build a full-fledge financial
institution even if they're using some

46
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:04,356
sort of virtual goods or virtual
currency-type system as part of their

47
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:09,327
platform. Again, this is something that
you're probably not going to run into with

48
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:15,094
most gamified systems, but worth keeping
in mind if there is real money going in or

49
00:04:15,094 --> 00:04:19,616
out of the system and there is some
tradable structure around a virtual

50
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:24,944
currency. The third one is gambling and
sweepstakes. So, again, if there's some

51
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:30,722
reward, some valuable tangible reward that
can be achieved thro ugh the system then,

52
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:35,632
there is the pote ntial to get swept up
under either sweepstakes laws which, at

53
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:40,064
least in the United States, are
predominantly issues at the state level,

54
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:44,620
where different states have different
requirements about what kinds of

55
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,512
sweepstakes you can do, whether, for
example, you have to require that someone

56
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:54,437
be able to enter the sweepstakes without
having bought your product and so forth,

57
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:59,061
that's one category. If the idea is
basically, this is a random drawing in

58
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:04,029
return for buying a ticket, participating
by using a product or something else, that

59
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:08,048
you're going to win some money if you're
the winner of the sweepstakes. Then

60
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:12,084
potentially, if the gamified system has
some structure that looks like that, you

61
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:16,098
have to think about those rules. Or, on
the other hand, if this is considered

62
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:21,051
gambling, then a whole other set of rules
apply, and these are predominantly at the

63
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:27,023
national level. So, in the United States,
interstate gambling, is by and large

64
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:33,532
prohibited. What is permitted is gambling
in designated areas, like Las Vegas and

65
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:37,735
Atlantic City, and on certain Indian
reservations, and government sponsored

66
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:42,688
lotteries, as well as a variety of other
things that are not quite considered

67
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:47,027
gambling. In many other countries,
gambling is permitted, but regulated for

68
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:52,341
access to children and so forth. And we
have all kinds of questions that come up

69
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:57,448
when online gambling sites locate outside
of the United States or in other places

70
00:05:57,448 --> 00:06:02,907
and then they're available to people in
different countries. The point here is

71
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:07,738
that if a gamified system seems like
gambling, I've already talked about a few

72
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:12,925
times the slot machine-like aspect of some
gamified systems and the fact that these

73
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:18,033
are systems that can actually tie into
real tangible rewards. If what this looks

74
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:23,437
like is a different way of gambling, then
potentially regulators will say, it's

75
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:28,499
subject to those gaming rules and maybe
even those prohibitions if it is in

76
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:33,572
country like the United States that has
regulations on gambling. So, this is again

77
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:38,690
something to think abo ut where there is
money involved. There is a distinction in

78
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,929
g ambling law between what are called,
games of skill and games of chance. The

79
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:49,021
idea being that basically gambling is all
over here, gambling is something where

80
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:53,556
essentially, you're not guaranteed that
you're going to win based on your skill,

81
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:58,577
you're just hoping to win based on, say, a
pull of the lever on a slot machine. On

82
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:03,838
the other hand, if it's primarily about
skill, if you're winning a prize for doing

83
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:08,304
something effectively whether that's
winning a prize for winning a sports

84
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:13,208
contest or for winning some other kind of
contest, where the most skillful person is

85
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:17,798
the winner, then, the gambling laws don't
necessarily apply in the same way. And the

86
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:22,564
question is in a gamified system where
there might be elements of randomness and

87
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:26,563
also elements of skill involved, which
side of the line would it fall under?

88
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:30,648
Again, if anything like this is
potentially an issue with the system that

89
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:35,144
you're involved with a good idea to call
in someone with more specific legal

90
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:39,413
knowledge to think about it and help
advise you on what to do. Now, these are,

91
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:44,208
by no means, all of the legal and
regulatory questions that might come up

92
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:49,852
with regard to gamification. But they're
some of the bigger ones that might lead to

93
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:55,071
a particularly serious problem if the
system covers the area that the legal or

94
00:07:55,071 --> 00:08:00,762
regulatory restriction involves and it's
not done in a way that takes into account

95
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:03,086
what those obligations might entail.
