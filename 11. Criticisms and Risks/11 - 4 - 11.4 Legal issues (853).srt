1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,054
You may not realize it from this course
but my degree is actually in law, and most

2
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:11,029
of my research work has been on legal and
policy aspects of the Internet and related

3
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:16,050
emerging technologies as opposed to the
more strategic and business oriented

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,325
aspects that were focused on this course
but the two things do come together. In

5
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:27,007
the discussion of legal issues around
gamification and while the primary

6
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:32,394
considerations in developing a gamified
system are not law so much. There are some

7
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:38,019
areas where legal and also regulatory
considerations could become important. And

8
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:43,062
so they are worth touching on in the
context of risks and concerns for defining

9
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:48,091
a gamified system. So let me quickly go
through five issues in which the legal

10
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:54,895
system could become a problem or you might
get sued by someone because of some issue

11
00:00:54,895 --> 00:01:00,016
in a gamified system. The first is
privacy. One of the aspects of

12
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:05,005
gamification is that you're going to get
lots of information potentially about

13
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:09,069
players, information about who they are,
their profile and so forth, but also

14
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:14,053
tremendously granular data about what
they're doing. Every action they take in

15
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:19,067
the game potentially can be collected and
that's a great thing. That's the basis of

16
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:23,628
the analytic and the ability of a well
designed gamified system optimized for the

17
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:28,317
players interest and to provide real
learnings for the company that sets it up.

18
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:34,025
But the flip side of that is the developer
of the gamified system is going to have

19
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:38,072
tremendously detailed and personal
information about the players. And that

20
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:43,056
necessarily brings it to play concerns
about privacy. Now privacy is a big legal

21
00:01:43,056 --> 00:01:48,065
area. It's developing very quickly. There
are lots of questions about privacy online

22
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:53,055
in various kinds of digital context which
are still not fully addressed by these

23
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:58,051
existing legal system. It's also something
that varies tremendously based on where

24
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:03,041
you are. Here in the United States where
I'm based, we tend to have a fairly less

25
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:08,816
on fair attitude toward privacy. We let
companies do a great deal without

26
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:14,070
prospective regulation in Europe and oth
er part s of the world there tends to be

27
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,099
much stricter constraints on what can be
done with private information, what sorts

28
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:25,002
of data collected and what can be done
with it. So be careful when designing a

29
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:29,060
gamified system especially any time you
are getting access to personal

30
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,083
identifiable information. Information that
tells you something definitely about a

31
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:40,025
single individual. Second issue flows from
the discussion earlier about exploitation

32
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:45,233
and playbore. The concern that a gamified
system could give rise to employment or

33
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:50,446
labor law issues. So I put up here the
graphic from the target checkout system

34
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:55,215
that tells people their score. And I
talked about the potential for that to

35
00:02:55,215 --> 00:03:00,034
feel manipulative to the workers. I also
gave you the example of the so called

36
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:05,020
electronic whip at the Disneyland Hotels.
That one in fact, came out of a labor

37
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,050
dispute where the workers were complaining
about their working conditions and one of

38
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,582
the issues that they brought up was this
leaderboard system. So, there are a

39
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:19,442
variety of rules in many countries
restricting what you can do as an employer

40
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:24,333
vis-a-vis your employees and there are
also are rules when employees get together

41
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:28,510
and want to collectively bargain. As with
many other aspects of law, they vary

42
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,462
country to country and employment law
restrictions tend to be far stricter in

43
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:38,568
European countries than they are in the
United States but even in the United

44
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:42,544
States there are limitations and
considerations on which you can do. So

45
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:47,452
these are issues that will come up in any
kind of internal gamification situation

46
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:52,290
where the game elements are being used in
some way that effects peoples work

47
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,699
performance. And the question is whether
it's being properly disclosed. And whether

48
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:03,062
it's consistent with what the law requires
as far as working conditions. Next issue

49
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:09,043
is the potential for deceptive marketing.
And so I gave you early in the course the

50
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:14,975
Jesse Schell video from Dice where he
talked about the potential of gamification

51
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:20,981
somewhat joking or sarcastically. And he
spun out these scenarios where gaming and

52
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:26,270
game elements w ere embedded as
advertising everywhere in the world and in

53
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:32,270
fact even piped directly into your brain
through some advertising mechanism. A lot

54
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,571
of those ideas if they became reality,
would give us pause. And there are rules

55
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:43,144
even when you don't go that far about what
you can do to market something. And in

56
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:48,078
particular, some of these concerns have to
do with stealth marketing. If the gamified

57
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:52,791
system is not clearly designed to market.
If people think that they're just playing

58
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:57,397
a game for fun, but in fact, this is
designed to get them to buy a product.

59
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:02,209
There might be a concern that that's some,
somehow a deceptive trade practice. Things

60
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:06,564
like advertising in particular are
regulated in some countries. So there's a

61
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:11,154
broad area there for external marketing
focus gamification where there might be

62
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:15,070
issues if it's not clear to the people
involved, that this is a marketing

63
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,068
technique. If it's clear, if people
understand that this is like advertising

64
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:23,394
or something else that's trying to sell
them something, then it's not necessarily

65
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:26,700
problematic. But the fact that the games
make people feel like something is

66
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,925
rewarding for some reason other than the
product they're getting, opens the door to

67
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:35,566
this being a problem. The next one is
intellectual property. This is a huge

68
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:40,633
issue across the board on all sorts of
digital technologies and digital

69
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:46,105
activities. Intellectual property law
regulates access to information or digital

70
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:51,995
assets. And so all of the virtual goods in
a gamified system, even things like the

71
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:57,626
badges, the visual aspects of the system
are potentially protected by intellectual

72
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:02,535
property law. And, this is an issue with
again, any kind of digital system. But

73
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:07,626
it's possible in designing a gamified
system, if you think that things like the

74
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:12,073
structure and the badges are something
that you can take from someone else's

75
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:16,913
system, you might run into problems in
that area. Beyond intellectual property

76
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:22,160
generally is the question about virtual
goods and virtual assets. And wheth er

77
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:27,960
they may have some legally protected value
above and beyond what they m ean in terms

78
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,896
of intellectual property. So this is an
issue that's come up with online games.

79
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:38,068
What happens if a user spends a tremendous
amount of time and effort and maybe even

80
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:43,138
pays real money to get something virtual
in the game. In the game what they get is

81
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:48,211
this beautiful building here, do they have
something of value? What happens if the

82
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:53,835
game designer wants to take it away. Poof.
It's gone. Or somehow change the rules and

83
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:59,714
the value. Does the person who acquired
that thing, again at great cost of time

84
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:05,013
and potentially cost of real money have
any legal claim as they would have for

85
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:10,075
example if someone sold them some physical
product and then tried to take it away in

86
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:16,282
an analogous situation. The courts so far
have said not really, the courts so far

87
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:21,287
have said this is a license. It's
something you get contractually but not

88
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:26,530
something you get as a property right. But
this is an emerging and evolving area of

89
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,069
the law, and one to keep an eye on in
things like gamification. There are also

90
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:36,508
are some specific issues with virtual
currencies. There's a law in the US called

91
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:41,915
the card act here which regulates gift
cards which are similar in some ways to

92
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:46,967
some of these gamified virtual assets or
virtual currencies. In that, you are

93
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:52,593
paying real money to get the gift card,
which then is a kind of virtual token that

94
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:56,688
you can redeem at the store. And so issues
come up like what if the gift card

95
00:07:56,688 --> 00:08:01,418
expires? Someone paid money for it, but
can the company then say great, we just

96
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:05,681
keep the money and don't have to give you
anything. There's potential for abuse

97
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:10,543
there, so that law regulates the use of
stored value in this way on cards. Not

98
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:14,392
clear how it applies in gamification, and
again here we're talking about

99
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:18,650
specifically things like virtual
currencies. Not badges and leaderboards

100
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,584
and so forth that, that don't have some
tangible value somehow attached to them.

101
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:27,350
But in that area there are some questions
that can be raised abo ut the legal

102
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,841
treatment of these kinds of services. So
all of these are issues to keep an eye out

103
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:35,648
for, depending on the nature of the
gamified system that you're developing.

104
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,877
There are of course, many other legal
issues that will come into play. Just like

105
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:44,500
any kind of business activity. But when in
doubt, probably a good idea to consult

106
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,825
with counsel or someone has some more
expertise about the legal issues

107
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:53,023
especially as they apply in the particular
jurisdiction that you're in.
