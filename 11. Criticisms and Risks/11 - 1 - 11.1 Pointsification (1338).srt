1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:05,057
The promise of gamification is to learn
from games, to draw on what makes games so

2
00:00:05,057 --> 00:00:10,088
powerful and apply it in other contexts.
So it's a fair question to ask whether

3
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:15,616
gamification can or in fact does actually
accomplish that? And there are many who

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:20,590
argue that it doesn't. This criticism goes
by the name of pointsification. A term

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,094
that was coined by Margaret Robertson. A
British game developer in her blog Hide

6
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:32,183
and Seek. And in her original post back in
2010, what she argued and what many other

7
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:38,080
had since developed in other ways is that
gamification is about taking the things

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,424
that is least essential from games and
representing it as the core of the

9
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:48,679
experience. In other words gamification
relies just on the surface aspects of

10
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:54,076
games. The mechanics. The other game
elements. And what she says is that's not

11
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:59,533
the important stuff. That's not the part
of games that makes them wonderful. That

12
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:05,088
gets people to play and that stimulates
that powerful set of motivational aspects

13
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:11,673
that we've talked about in the course. So
what she says is, as she goes on in the

14
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:17,503
post, effectively gamification is an
inadvertent con. It's genuine. It's trying

15
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:22,124
to take something valuable from games but
it's taking the wrong thing. And in so

16
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:26,861
doing it's inadvertently misleading
people. It's suggesting to people that

17
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:31,801
what's great about games is that they have
things like point systems and

18
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:36,609
leaderboards. When in fact that's not
what's central or important about games at

19
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:42,241
all. And there's a great deal of bite to
this criticism. As we've talked about many

20
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:47,476
gamified system rely principally on
points, badges, leaderboards and a few

21
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:53,274
other surface level game mechanics. And,
well may that have some valuable fact that

22
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:59,048
we can link them to other sorts of
activities like loyalty programs. They

23
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:05,655
don't necessarily produce the sense of
true engagement and the sense of intrinsic

24
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:11,740
motivation, that's so important to really
changeing behavior and really producing

25
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,760
sustained results in ways that are
beneficial for people involved in the

26
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,807
system. So there is a legitimate criticism
here aro und pointsification. But to my

27
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:26,644
mind it's one that can be addressed by
thinking about gamification more broadly.

28
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:31,368
As I've talked about, there really are two
streams of work that feed into

29
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:36,038
gamification. The one that Robertson and
the other critics are talking about when

30
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:40,560
they label it pointsification is entirely
on the behavioral side. And it's the

31
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,199
shallower aspects of applying those
behavioral techniques through

32
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,961
gamification. Again, predominately using
simple mechanics like points and leader

33
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:54,442
boards, and thinking that they can just be
slapped onto processes and produce

34
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:59,357
results. I would certainly agree that
that's limiting, and that, that doesn't

35
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:03,960
produce the same kinds of powerful results
that we can see from games, but...

36
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,205
Gamification at least appropriately
thought of is much more than that. So part

37
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:15,100
of the criticism of pointification is
focusing in on a limited set but a very

38
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,070
real set of gamification examples and
practises. And I think that we can take it

39
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:27,239
to heart without necessarily writing off
the entire practice of gamification. But

40
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,431
an important question this raises is
whether gamification really is effective.

41
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:40,010
Robertson as a game designer was concerned
about gamification having the effect of

42
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,024
belittling games. That if people started
to think, "Oh wait. Games are just about

43
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:48,092
points and badges and stuff like that."
And those really aren't that effective. So

44
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:53,000
therefore games must not be that
interesting or powerful, either. As a game

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,078
designer, that was her concern. She wasn't
particularly concerned about gamification

46
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:03,053
as a practice. But those of us who are in
the gamification field certainly are. And

47
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:09,050
so it's worth asking whether if
gamification reduces to pointsification,

48
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:15,004
then that means that it won't produce the
kind of sustained, important, deep

49
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:21,078
engagement that's necessary to drive real
business results and real behavior change.

50
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:26,013
And the challenge here is we don't have a
tremendous amount of research. In this

51
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:31,060
course, I have given you many different
examples, some anecdotal, some involving

52
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,015
data points. But we do n't hav e yet
significant empirical research,

53
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:41,096
systematically looking at different forms
of gamification and the results that it

54
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:46,443
can provide in the enterprise, in external
marketing context, in behavior change

55
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:50,733
context. There are social scientists,
people like my colleague, Ethan Mollick,

56
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:55,124
here at the Wharton School, who started to
do research in this area. And I think that

57
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:59,918
we'll see research start to come about
that informs gamification practice. But up

58
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,121
to this point, it's limited. I think
there's enough examples. Again, we've seen

59
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:09,186
many of them in this course that suggest
that these techniques are valid, and can

60
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:13,814
work if designed and applied
appropriately. But we don't yet know as

61
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:18,801
much as we need to about what the data
really show in large scale practical

62
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:24,732
deployments. The second issue that this
comes to is that gamification if it does

63
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:29,954
reduce to pointsification, if most of the
time or at least some of the time it turns

64
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:35,193
out to just be about using these shallow
elements. There's a very real risk that

65
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:41,397
engagement may spike initially but will
then decay. That people may feel that

66
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:49,361
initial boost from the surprise or the
activity and engagement loops of feedback.

67
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:54,772
But ultimately if they're just driven by
those behaviourist rewards or just driven

68
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:59,191
by the surface level mechanics they'll get
bored. And that won't produce an induring

69
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:04,483
response. That's I think a fair criticism
and something to be aware of in designing

70
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:10,495
gamified systems. And yet another reason.
Not to just stop by thinking about these

71
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:15,931
simple points based mechanics. The third
aspect of this is one that we've already

72
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:21,359
talked about, which is the potential for
crowding out, or over justification. So,

73
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:27,449
if in fact gamification becomes just
pointsification, then it falls victim to

74
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:33,472
all the dangers of extrinsic rewards that
I described in some of the psychology

75
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:40,355
sections. All of this together is what is
like Kathy Sierra, who is a noted author

76
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:46,466
and speaker around interaction design and
programming in other areas. She has been a

77
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:52,723
frequent critic of gamifica tion and has
labeled it, I think very powerfully as the

78
00:06:52,723 --> 00:06:59,007
high fructose corn syrup of engagement and
what I think she's saying there is first

79
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:04,065
of all that it takes the richness, the
real organic value of games and of human

80
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:09,062
engagement, and reduces it down to
something very simplistic and very shrill.

81
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:13,409
And that it's something like corn syrup
high fructose corn syrup that seems great

82
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:18,056
because it's sweet and cheap. But that as
we learn more turns out to potentially be

83
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:23,366
harmful for us. In the sense here, that if
we rely too much on these simplistic,

84
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:29,414
external reward based systems, that it
will push people away from the true

85
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:36,278
intrinsic motivation. Love of the
activity, love of the task, love of the

86
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:41,343
process. That is what should ultimately be
driving them. And as with the

87
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:46,475
pointsification critic more broadly, this
is something worth taking into account.

88
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:51,119
Now, again I tend to think that its not a
fatal critic of all of gamification for

89
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:55,829
the reason that are described in the
course but its something that you should

90
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:00,078
always have in mind when designing
systems. And always try to think about how

91
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:05,274
avoid sliding down that path where infact
what you are doing is not gamafiying, but

92
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:10,209
just applying point systems or applying
game mechanics and other game elements in

93
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:14,194
situations where they are not truely
appropriate. So, let's turn back to the

94
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:19,386
Foursquare example. Foursquare, in many
ways, was a tremendous success story for

95
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:24,781
gamification. The use of game elements,
the badges, the points and so forth, on

96
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:29,824
top of the social location system that was
pioneered by Dodgeball, helped power

97
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:34,428
Foursquare to tremendous success and
tremendous adoption. But along the way

98
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:38,461
something interesting happened. Early in
2012 Foursquare did a redesign. They

99
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:44,039
changed the interface of the system in a
way that appeared to significantly

100
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,023
de-emphasize the game elements. So here
you see some screen shots of the

101
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:55,072
Foursquare iPhone client. And you see
here's one main screen that shows

102
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:59,075
information about your friends and where
they are and information that yo u can

103
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:04,028
post. And you notice. Not a lot of game
elements actu ally there. And here's the

104
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:08,049
screen showing your friends, where they've
checked in on the map. Again, the game

105
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:12,850
elements aren't that prominent. It's only
when you get to this third screen here

106
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:18,082
that we see. The stats with the crown we
see the badges that you've accomplished,

107
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:23,060
that you've achieved and so forth. So the
game elements are still there, but they

108
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,042
appear to much less prominent. So the
question is what lesson to draw from this

109
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:33,026
and I think one can draw a couple of
different lessons. One conclusion is..

110
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:37,085
Gamification didn't work. The game
elements either didn't actually produce

111
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:42,019
business results or maybe they did for
awhile but then people got bored. People

112
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:46,069
got tired of them. The badges just became
something silly and not something that

113
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:51,054
really motivated people to want to check
in and participate in the service. Or

114
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:57,008
maybe another conclusion one could draw is
that the game elements are still there.

115
00:09:57,008 --> 00:10:01,031
And still important to the service. But it
was much more important to make them

116
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:05,069
prominent during the early days when
Foursquare was trying to grow, trying to

117
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:10,023
get out of that trap that I described
early on, where there was no reason for

118
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:14,053
people to check in if their friends were
checking in. And there were no real

119
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:19,033
super-users who had a motivation to go and
check in all the time at certain location

120
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:23,073
and post information. So perhaps the game
elements were particularly important

121
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:28,011
during that growth phase for the company.
And now that it reached the critical mass,

122
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:33,931
where the key is monetization and building
out off of the large number of users to

123
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:39,939
real rich informational and social value
that people can extract out, and that gets

124
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:44,705
people to put more deep information into
the system. Maybe at that point. The

125
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:49,783
point, badge and leader board type game
elements are less central. So you can

126
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:54,819
decide whichever of those stories you
think persuades you or maybe some other

127
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:59,663
story. But again, in thinking about
gamefication in practice , it behooves

128
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:04,718
everyone to try to keep questionin g
whether this is a technique that's worth

129
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:08,662
using. I think it's one that can be
extremely valuable in many different

130
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:13,761
areas. Going from very lightweight systems
to much more sophisticated deployments.

131
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,741
But it's, again, not something that's
useful for everyone, and not something

132
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:23,118
that's useful in every single case. So,
what are some implications to take away

133
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:27,385
from this discussion? First, names are
powerful. Much of the fire behind the

134
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:32,577
criticism of gamification from game
designers hinges on the word,

135
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:37,970
gamification. Because it implies that this
is about games. And I think, if you think

136
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,106
about it broadly as I have talked about,
it is. It involves using many different

137
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:47,343
aspects of games and many different
aspects of game design practice. But it is

138
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:53,025
true that if gamification is just pulling
out points at the few other mechanics,

139
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:59,445
then it is something substantially less.
Than the full panoply of richness that

140
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:05,493
games entail. So names matter. The problem
is names are names, and gamification is

141
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:10,087
the name that has stuck. Maybe eventually
it will go away or change into something

142
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:15,020
else, but for now it's the word that gets
used for this practice. Second point is,

143
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,012
bad de-gamification is bad. So it's true
that if gamification just uses points,

144
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:23,941
badges, and leader boards, especially if
it does it in a very shallow way, and

145
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:28,563
certainly there are many examples of that
today, that it's going to be limited. It's

146
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:33,932
not going to produce sustained engagement,
and it may, in fact, be harmful. It may,

147
00:12:33,932 --> 00:12:40,861
in fact, produce the kind of backlash, the
crowding out effect that we described in

148
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:47,430
the discussion of behaviorism and
psychology. Third point is that there's

149
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:53,141
more to games than gamification. So games
do involve many other aspects beyond the

150
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:57,468
ones that we've talked about in this
class. And there's more to gamification

151
00:12:57,468 --> 00:13:03,116
than games. Gamification draws upon areas
like phsychology and design and business

152
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:07,922
practice and social media in many ways
that go beyond or go in different

153
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:12,021
directions than game design and that's
fine. That's one reason it's important t o

154
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:16,662
keep straight whether we're talking about
games including for example serio us game

155
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:21,409
design. Or talking about gamification
where the goal is to apply to some

156
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:27,530
non-game context. And, final lesson here.
Caveat Ludor, let the gamifier beware.

157
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:33,321
Make sure to always keep in mind. The
difference between gamification and

158
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:37,092
pointsification and to recognize the bite
that, that criticism has.
