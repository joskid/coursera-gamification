1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,520
Now that I've introduced the concept of 
fun, let's look more systematically 

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,240
because knowing that there are many 
different things that can produce fun 

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,140
doesn't necessarily mean tell us as much 
as we need to know to apply the concept 

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:18,410
of fun in either game design or 
gamification. 

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,301
Nicole Lazzaro is a researcher and game 
designer who has a firm called XEOesign, 

6
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:27,550
and she has specialized in emotion in 
games. 

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:33,17
She's actually done foundational research 
tracking people's eyes and faces and 

8
00:00:33,17 --> 00:00:37,637
looking at what in games actually 
produces fun, and you can find out more 

9
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:44,80
of her research on her website. 
I put a link here to an image file that 

10
00:00:44,80 --> 00:00:48,636
provides much more detail, as well as the 
original white paper that describes her 

11
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:53,546
findings. 
Lazzaro talks about four keys to fun, 

12
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:58,878
four different kinds of fun that are 
general categories that appear in any 

13
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,670
kind of game-like context. 
So, what are they? 

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,749
The first is easy fun. 
Fun that's about blowing off steam. 

15
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:13,321
Just chilling out, goofing off, hanging 
out with your friends. 

16
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:18,40
It doesn't have to be taxing. 
In fact, you don't want it to be taxing. 

17
00:01:18,40 --> 00:01:23,10
It's fun just because it's casual, it's 
light, it's nice. 

18
00:01:23,10 --> 00:01:28,110
It's fun because it's easy. 
Second category is just the opposite. 

19
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,730
It's hard fun. 
So, how can fun be hard? 

20
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,358
Well, as I've talked about challenges, 
problem solving, mastery, completion, 

21
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:45,80
overcoming obstacles, all of these things 
are fun in their own right. 

22
00:01:45,80 --> 00:01:47,528
So, we think of those things as fun 
because the fun represents 

23
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:51,782
accomplishment. 
It represents overcoming something and 

24
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:57,410
that's what makes the activity fun if 
we're able to reach that plateau. 

25
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:02,980
So, second category is hard fun. 
Third category is people fun. 

26
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,900
I guess I underlined the other one so I 
underline easy as well. 

27
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,997
The fun of interacting with others, the 
fun of working together on a team. 

28
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:16,536
The fun of socializing, fun that requires 
other people. 

29
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:20,956
Now, that could wind up being hard fun or 
easy fun as well, but this differentiates 

30
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:26,440
out the aspect of that fun that comes 
from the social interaction. 

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,160
And finally, there is what she calls 
serious fun. 

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,700
Well, fun can be hard. 
How can fun be serious? 

33
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,840
I thought serious was the opposite of 
fun. 

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,594
Not really. 
First of all, some kinds of fun tie into 

35
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:42,957
serious real objectives. 
So, I talked about the fun of giving to 

36
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:46,870
others, there's a fun in doing things 
that are meaningful. 

37
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,250
There's a fun in doing things that are 
good for the planet, good for the family, 

38
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,788
good for your community. 
There is also a fun in doing things that 

39
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:58,922
have a meaning for you. 
So, you recall that when I talked about 

40
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:03,732
some of the aspects of games, the magic 
circle, and so forth, part of what makes 

41
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:07,950
something game-like is that some 
objective that has no real outside 

42
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:15,298
purpose has a purpose within the game. 
And it becomes engaging because, in the 

43
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:19,620
game, that's meaningful to you. 
So, this relates to fun as well. 

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,306
In particular, when we're talking about 
things like collections, pulling together 

45
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:28,596
something, getting a whole bunch of 
badges to unlock some sort of award, is 

46
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:34,870
fun because it's meaningful in some 
serious way for you at that time. 

47
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,882
It may not be something that someone else 
finds fun or meaningful but for you there 

48
00:03:38,882 --> 00:03:42,780
is some objective involved, some meaning 
involved. 

49
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,492
And so, Lazzaro would call that serious 
fun. 

50
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:52,764
Four different kinds of fun. 
All different and not necessarily 

51
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:57,364
mutually exclusive. 
So, the same game may be one or more of 

52
00:03:57,364 --> 00:04:01,252
these things. 
The point is, when we think about fun, we 

53
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:05,800
can't limit ourself to just focusing on 
one aspect or another. 

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,448
If we think that fun is just something 
easy and casual, we'll miss the 

55
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:13,416
opportunity to engage people and make 
things fun using some of these other 

56
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:17,810
categories. 
Now, other game designers that come up 

57
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,812
with their own frameworks, one of them, 
that's fairly well-known is from a game 

58
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:25,582
designer named Marc LeBlanc who developed 
a framework, that I'll talk about a 

59
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:30,170
little bit later, for conceptualizing 
games. 

60
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,533
And as part of that, he came up with 8 
different kinds of fun, slightly 

61
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:37,420
different template than what Lazarro 
talked about. 

62
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,720
I won't go into these in detail but just 
to get you thinking about different ways 

63
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,368
to structure, thinking about fun. 
LeBlanc talks about the 8 as sensation, 

64
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:52,416
fantasy, narrative, challenge, 
fellowship, discovery, expression, and 

65
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:57,468
submission. 
That last one, submission, is just the 

66
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:01,870
casual kind of fun, just something as a 
pastime. 

67
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,835
And if you really want to dig into what 
fun means for game design, I recommend to 

68
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:10,516
you a book by Raph Koster, A Theory of 
Fun for Game Design. 

69
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:15,956
A classic book talking about how game 
designers can think about fun and apply 

70
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:19,530
it. 
It's very conversational, gets you 

71
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,290
thinking. 
So, if you're looking for something else 

72
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,184
to dig deeper, that would be a good place 
to go. 

73
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:27,993
Alright, so some takeaways. 
What do we learn from this extended 

74
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:31,866
discussion about fun? 
Three things that I would have you take 

75
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:36,60
away from this. 
So, first is should go without saying, 

76
00:05:36,60 --> 00:05:40,710
fun doesn't just happen, it has to be 
designed. 

77
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,901
I'm going to talk later in the course 
about design frameworks for gamification. 

78
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:48,641
And it's really important to understand 
that fun is not just something that's out 

79
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:52,769
there in the world. 
Sometimes, things just happen to be fun. 

80
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,985
But if we're talking about making 
something game-like, about motivating 

81
00:05:56,985 --> 00:06:01,541
people to go and use less electricity,or 
to go and spend more time on your website 

82
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:05,961
or to go and work together on a team to 
solve a problem on a project at work, we 

83
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:10,313
have to build systems that are expressly 
designed to unlock these different 

84
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:19,83
aspects of fun. 
Second is, fun isn't always easy, fun 

85
00:06:19,83 --> 00:06:26,530
isn't always simple, fun isn't always a 
purely happy positive experience. 

86
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,230
Fun can be hard, fun can be challenging, 
fun can be serious. 

87
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,144
And we tend to ignore that when we're 
thinking about fun, we shouldn't when 

88
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:38,552
we're designing gamified systems. 
Finally, there are different kinds of 

89
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:41,586
fun. 
Whether you take Lazzaro's four or 

90
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:46,39
LaBlanc's eight or some other template, 
the point is fun is a very nuanced 

91
00:06:46,39 --> 00:06:50,260
concept. 
And we should look to exploit as many 

92
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,510
kinds of fun as possible. 
It's not always the right answer or the 

93
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,410
best answer to focus in on one kind of 
fun because we're missing opportunities 

94
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,993
to make things fun in different ways.
