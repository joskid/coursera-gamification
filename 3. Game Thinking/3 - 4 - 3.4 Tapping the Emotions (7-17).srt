1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,012
I've been talking about game thinking and
very clinical or structural terms, very

2
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:14,025
process oriented. It's important though,
as you're doing that, not to lose sight of

3
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:20,666
what really makes games engaging, the
emotional component of the experience.

4
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:27,099
And, we can represent in one very short
word what it is that makes games engaging.

5
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:35,706
Games are engaging because they are fun.
Fun is a word that we use to represent

6
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:41,007
what it is about things like games that
makes them good, makes them wonderful that

7
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:45,883
engages us that makes us want start to
playing them and want to keep playing

8
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:51,055
them. Fun is a hard word to get your arms
around kind of like games. But, as we are

9
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:56,753
able to define games we will be able to
define fun at least define some aspects of

10
00:00:56,753 --> 00:01:01,950
what makes things fun. The starting point
is a quote from the great philosopher,

11
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,904
Mary Poppins who noted that in every job
there is to be done, there is an element

12
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:13,839
of fun. You find the fun and snap, the
job's a game. Important point here, notice

13
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:19,084
what she's talking about. She's talking
about, jobs. She's not talking about

14
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:24,714
playtime. She's talking about how to make
things that you have to do fun. And, of

15
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:29,006
course, in the context of the play, that's
an important lesson that she's teaching,

16
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:33,088
but it points up something very
significant. Fun is not limited to

17
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:39,026
recreation, fun is not limited to
entertainment, fun is something that we

18
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:45,024
can enjoy at work. It's something that we
can enjoy in all sorts of contacts and

19
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:50,015
therefore when we think about
gamification, think about making work or

20
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:56,129
social impact or behavior change seem more
engaging in game like it's essential to

21
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:01,945
think about how to make it fun. But the
question is what's fun. So think of it

22
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:06,869
yourself. What are some of the kinds of
things that you feel are fun? I'm not

23
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,973
saying an activity, I'm not saying that
you think it's fun to jump out of

24
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:16,932
airplanes or something like that. What are
the categories of emotions or the

25
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:22,191
categories of experiences that you would
think of as fun? Try to think about as

26
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:27,451
many different possible ones as you can
and think about how th ey relate to

27
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:32,093
different kinds of fun. Here are some
things that I've come up with that are

28
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:36,184
fun. Winning. All right, that's an easy
one. Many games have the idea of winners

29
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:40,496
and losers, and certainly winning is
something that we think of as fun, but

30
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:45,621
it's not the only thing. Problem-solving.
Sometimes the fun comes in overcoming

31
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:50,446
obstacles. In surmounting challenges,
whether we win or not, even if the

32
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:55,801
activity doesn't have the notion of a
winner. Just solving the problem,

33
00:02:55,801 --> 00:03:01,442
achieving something that, in itself is
fun. Or sometimes just exploring, just

34
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:07,476
finding something new feels like fun to us
whether or not it's embedded in some kind

35
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:13,490
of challenge or some kind of game that has
winners or losers. Or what about just

36
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:19,569
chilling out. Lying on a beautiful beach
in the sun relaxing, at least for me, is

37
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:26,186
fun. Even though it doesn't have any of
those other attributes. Teamwork. We are

38
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:32,621
hardwired as a species to enjoy
collaborating and cooperating with others.

39
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:38,285
Working together as a team to achieve a
goal independently feels like fun.

40
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:43,848
Recognition. Now recognition is little bit
like winning, but it's not some objective

41
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:49,209
standard that says you have been
victorious in the game, it's someone else

42
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,672
has told you that you did a good job.
That's fun, that's feel good, whether or

43
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:59,937
not it means you have won the game.
Triumphing. Now here I'm talking about

44
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:05,985
something that is similar to winning, but
that has a particular aspect of it of

45
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:12,060
which is you win, and someone else loses,
vanquishing your opponent. Some people

46
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,682
find that independently fun, above and
beyond the joy of winning, the notion that

47
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:24,656
you've crushed someone else. Collecting We
find it fun to assemble things together

48
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:29,474
into collections. That's why some people
love to collect antiques or certain

49
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:34,580
categories of objects, and we find this
more generally in games when [inaudible]

50
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,530
people have an opportunity to assemble a
bunch of things, even if that's not an

51
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:45,170
express objective of the game, people do
it voluntarily because they find it fun.

52
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,896
Surprise. There's something fun about
being surprised. Why [laugh] do we love

53
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:56,603
[laugh] surprise parties? Because the idea
of surprise, of some novelty, something we

54
00:04:56,603 --> 00:05:02,194
didn't expect, is independently fun. And
this will tie in later on when I start to

55
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:07,884
talk about psychology, the way that our
brain actually releases the chemical

56
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:13,999
dopamine when something is unexpected. And
the reward that we get is one that we

57
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:19,442
didn't anticipate, more so than if it's
the same reward that we expected.

58
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:25,312
Imagination. Daydreaming is fun. Just
thinking about ideas and imagining

59
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:32,324
something in your head has an element of
fun in and of itself. Sharing. Being

60
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:37,836
altruistic is fun. People feel good when
they give money to charity, again,

61
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:42,622
something that we are hardwired to think
about as a species. Now, it doesn't mean

62
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:47,621
that every time we share, it's fun, and
everyone shares everything all the time.

63
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:53,032
Anyone who has kids knows that getting
them to share is not always an easy task.

64
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:58,768
But there is an element of fun in the act
of altruism or sharing or giving someone a

65
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:03,359
gift. Role playing. We love trying on
roles. We love pretending that we're

66
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:08,635
someone else inhabiting another character,
whether that's all the way at the level of

67
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:14,022
a role playing game, where we are playing
a night elf druid or something to that

68
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:19,456
effect to the more lightweight ideas of
imagining ourselves in someone else's

69
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:24,503
shoes. Customization. It's fun to be able
to make something our own. It's fun to be

70
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:29,702
able to decide exactly the color that you
want for every aspect of the Nike shoes

71
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:34,978
that you buy. We love to be able to
personalize and customize things. And

72
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:41,963
finally, goofing off. There's something
fun about just letting it all hang out

73
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:49,055
about exploring the opportunity to just be
silly. All right. So, think about, for a

74
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:54,449
game or for a business process, or some
objective that you can imagine, or

75
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:59,866
perhaps, some of the ones that we've
already covered in the course, how you

76
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:05,802
might use the different kinds of fun that
we've identified, to produce an emotional

77
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:11,725
response to engage people in the activity.
And then next, we'll look a little more

78
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:17,011
systematically about how game designers
understand the concept of fun.
