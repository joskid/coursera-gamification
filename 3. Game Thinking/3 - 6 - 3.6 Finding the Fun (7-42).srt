1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,031
You can find fun in unexpected places. So,
here's a few examples about how to gamify

2
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:12,025
things that might not necessarily seem
like great candidates. Volkswagen had a

3
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:18,034
wonderful campaign called The Fun Theory,
and I've already given you one example

4
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:23,017
from that contest. The winning entry
called the speed camera lottery. Where

5
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:28,039
people would drive by a camera and if you
weren't speeding you'd automatically be

6
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,073
entered into a lottery and win some of the
money collected from the people who were

7
00:00:33,073 --> 00:00:38,074
speeding. But that competition that
Volkswagen did had a variety of other

8
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:44,035
entries as well as some examples that
Volkswagen themselves came up with through

9
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:49,082
their marketing agency. So I'd like to ask
you to go and look at the fun theory

10
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:55,001
website and check out some of the
examples. In particular, look at the piano

11
00:00:55,001 --> 00:01:00,083
stairs, where they created a playing piano
on the steps coming up from a subway stop

12
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:06,044
and the fact that you could walk up and
play the piano was so fun that many more

13
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:11,519
people chose to do that as opposed to take
the escalator next to it, good for those

14
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,613
people. They get more exercise because
they're having fun. Or the world's deepest

15
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:23,219
trashcan where they instrumented an
ordinary trashcan with sensors so that

16
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,942
when you threw some trash in it, you'd
hear a sound [sound]. [sound] As though it

17
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:34,411
was a deep cavern that you were throwing
something into. Again, people found that

18
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:40,077
kind of fun, and they were curious about
it, and that fact alone encouraged more

19
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:45,446
people to throw their trash into the trash
can. Good result. So go look at the Fun

20
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:51,103
Theory website, and try to familiarize
yourself with some of the different ways

21
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:57,466
to make fun that don't obviously seem like
they're good candidates. I'd like to give

22
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:03,281
you one other example and this is
something that may seem so basic and

23
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:08,897
simple, and dull frankly that it wouldn't
lend itself to fun but it was a case where

24
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:14,554
a little bit of game thinking went a long
way to generating real business results.

25
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:20,337
And it comes from LinkedIn, the business
social networking site. So on LinkedIn you

26
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:25,030
fill out a profile. Y ou describe your job
history, your employment, your skills.

27
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,038
There's places where you can put in
references from other people. And, all

28
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:33,696
sorts of details that are relevant to
understanding your capabilities for jobs

29
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:38,531
or other business opportunities. It's
important to LinkedIn that you fill in

30
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:42,909
your profile as completely as possible.
First of all that means you're more

31
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:47,336
committed to the site. And you may go for
some of their paid services. Second of

32
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:52,225
all, it makes it easy for other people to
find you and search on you, and therefore

33
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:57,257
makes it easier for you to network and get
some of the benefits that LinkedIn wants

34
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:02,024
you to get as a way of selling you, again,
their various kinds of services. And

35
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:06,781
finally, more data means more that
LinkedIn can search and analyze in order

36
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:11,874
to understand patterns in their users and
target you more effectively. So they want

37
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:16,408
you to fill in the profile in every
possible detail. But, filling out profiles

38
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:21,134
is pretty boring. Hard to think about how
to make that fun. Linkedin though, came up

39
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:26,019
with a way and it's not the way that you
might think in terms of creating some

40
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:31,002
profile game where you get points and
badges for filling out your profile, nope.

41
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:36,258
It was something much simpler. It was
this, the profile completeness bar. Took

42
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:42,214
about an hour for someone to code and
putting into the Linkedin system and it's

43
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:47,600
pretty simple. It just says here's how
much of your profile you filled out. In

44
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,580
this case, 90 percent and here's some
advice about how to fill it out more. Now

45
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,005
is that a game? No, not really. It doesn't
have the kinds of rules and the kinds of

46
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:06,097
objectives that we might think of as game.
It's also just so simple that no one would

47
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:11,414
really say, you are going to sit sown and
play the profile bar completion game

48
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:17,390
against someone else or against yourself.
It's just not that interesting. But it's a

49
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,563
little bit fun. It's a little bit
game-like, and just enough to encourage

50
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:28,088
people in meaningful ways to fill out
their profiles more. Because it turns out

51
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:33,991
that when LinkedIn put this profile bar
in, this very simple little [inaudible]

52
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:39,645
feature change that they added to their
service, profile completeness went up by

53
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:45,116
twenty%. A material increase in the amount
of data people were putting in just from

54
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:50,384
this little progress bar. So, what is it
about the progress bar that's at all

55
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:55,521
gamelike and that gets people to respond?
Well, here's a few things that I might

56
00:04:55,521 --> 00:05:00,482
point out. The first thing is feedback.
So, the progress bar tells you how far

57
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:04,977
along you are. Before you just saw your
profile where it was. However much you

58
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:09,201
filled out. Maybe there were some things
that were blank. But now all of a sudden

59
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:12,977
you see, "I'm, 90 percent of the way
there." And, when you fill out something

60
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:17,420
else. When I get the other recommendation
I'm gonna see 95 percent there. And the

61
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,124
bar will move a little bit further towards
the edge. Immediate real-time feedback

62
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:26,559
about performance. Very common and
important aspect of games. Here, feedback

63
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:31,349
just gives you a number, gives you some
information, doesn't enforce you to do

64
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:35,502
anything with it. But that's
psychologically creates a dynamic that

65
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:41,130
makes people more likely to progress. And
that's the second aspect of what the bar

66
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:47,168
does. It creates a sense of progression.
So now we're no longer just talking about

67
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:52,363
entering data, filling out forms. We're
now talking about moving from the

68
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:57,630
beginning to the end of a process. And
that there are various little things that

69
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,189
we can do that are steps along the way.
It's not just start with nothing and end

70
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:08,471
up complete. It's a process of moving
forward of completing this objective. So

71
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:14,138
even though nothing in the profile bar is
expressly telling you that and even though

72
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:19,587
no one would say "yes, I am excited about
achieving the objective or progressing to

73
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:24,208
the end of the profile bar" there's that
little pole, there's that little

74
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:29,329
psychological draw of wanting to progress
to the end of the game and that's the

75
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:34,616
final point completion. We know now how
far we are from the end and in this case I

76
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:40,611
am pretty close, look here's all it's left
for me to get to 100%, is this little bit

77
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:46,553
at the end of the bar. We like completion.
We like neatness. We like finishing up a

78
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:52,147
collection. It's something that, again,
psychologically we're wired to want to do.

79
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:58,041
And seeing visually, in a simple way, how
close we are to the end, again, just draws

80
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:04,256
us along subtly and imperceptibly to want
to reach that objective. So this LinkedIn

81
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:09,499
progress bar, as simple as it was, as
trivial as it may seem was enough to

82
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:15,086
actually drive real results. And that's
what gamification does. It doesn't require

83
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:20,918
you to create an environment where people
are enthralled, where they are totally

84
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:26,969
focused in, that this is the most exciting
thing in their life. Hey, it's great when

85
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:32,467
you can do that. But gamification is about
finding the fun, finding the game-like

86
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:38,230
aspects wherever they are, and using them
to create an environment that moves people

87
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,075
a little bit more towards an objective.
