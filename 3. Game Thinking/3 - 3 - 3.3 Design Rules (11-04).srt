1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,070
So, you've oriented yourself to thinking
like a game designer. The next step is to

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:11,053
focus in on some of the basic design rules
that go into good game design. The first

3
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:17,017
of these is the player journey. We've
talked about thinking of your customers or

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:22,016
your audience as players. Part of what
that means is realizing that the player is

5
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,073
engaged in an experience. The player is
going through a journey in playing your

6
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:31,042
game. And the game doesn't have to give
them a 3-D virtual environment, where they

7
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:35,093
are getting in a car, or on a horse, and
riding around a territory to have that

8
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:40,038
journey. The journey is the conceptual
path that they follow through the game.

9
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:44,681
Because you don't want your player journey
to be just a random walk, because you

10
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:48,938
don't know where the player's going to
get. And ultimately that becomes

11
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:56,590
uninteresting. You want the player journey
to have a beginning, a middle, and an end.

12
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:04,037
And ideally, those are in some sort of
progression. The player always starts at

13
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:09,079
the beginning. You want the player to get
to a point of mastery and to have that

14
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:15,030
journey be seamless. So, the first aspect
of the player journey is onboarding. So,

15
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,060
in other words, how to get the player into
the game as quickly and easily as

16
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,034
possible? The second aspect is
scaffolding. How does the game provide

17
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:31,038
training wheels if you will? Places where
the game makes it easier and overcomes

18
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:37,011
some of the complexity that otherwise
would get a user stuck. That otherwise

19
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:43,023
would have the player not realize what
they need to do next. And finally does the

20
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:49,049
game enable that player to get to mastery?
To get to the point where the player has

21
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,015
conquered and achieved some real skill.
Some real accomplishment within the

22
00:01:55,015 --> 00:02:00,080
framework of the game. So, let's look at
an example of how this works in, and

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,016
actual video game. I'd like you to go and
play the first level of Plants vs.

24
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:11,037
Zombies. Many of you already have, Plants
vs. Zombies has been an extremely

25
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:17,009
successful casual game on mobile devices
and the web as well. And you can go and,

26
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,298
play the web-based version for free. And
aga in, just play the first easy level of

27
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:28,043
the game, and think about how does this
game do onboarding and scaffolding? It's

28
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:33,063
level one, so you won't be able to see at
that point but half the mastery. But what

29
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:38,088
are the things that the game does that get
users quickly into the game and make it

30
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:43,077
easier for them to make progress within
the game. Go check it out and then come

31
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:50,797
back. Okay. Hope you had fun with that.
So, how does Plants vs Zombies onboard you

32
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:56,103
and scaffold the experience? Here are few
things I've picked up. It gives you guides

33
00:02:56,103 --> 00:03:00,984
which deliberately say, here's what you
should do. Go pick up this seed packet. Go

34
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:05,928
put this down on the lawn. It does that
sometimes verbally with a direct guide and

35
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:10,485
sometimes just by highlighting something.
The flashing that tells you intuitively,

36
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:15,513
this is where I should click, or this is
where I should put something. It gives you

37
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:19,818
express feedback. Good job. Reinforces
that you did the right thing. The game

38
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:24,661
also is dumb down. There's a limit of what
you can do. So, at this point on level

39
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:29,764
one, you get one lane of grass only, only
one place you can put your plant. Once the

40
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:34,107
game gets going, there's a lot more
choices that you have both in terms of

41
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:38,772
what plant to use and where to put it. And
if the game were just one kind of plant on

42
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:43,796
one lane of grass, it would be pretty dull
after a while, after just a couple of

43
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:48,240
levels. But starting off, you need that
simplification because otherwise, the

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,258
games quickly becomes to complex to
understand and similarly there is only one

45
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:58,369
kind of monster. The result of which is
that the game at this level is

46
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:03,056
unbelievably easy. You have to try very
hard. I know probably some of you did die

47
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:07,341
on that level because you deliberately
didn't put something down, but you have to

48
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:11,767
try hard to fail at that level. It's
almost automatic that you will level up

49
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:16,199
and get that reinforced minute feedback
and reward of achieving something at that

50
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,757
first level. And also you will become
educated and be able to move up to the

51
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:24,885
next level of difficulty. All of this is
without any kind of manu al. Think about

52
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:29,899
it. If you had to explain to someone how
Plants vs. Zombies works. There's your

53
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:34,993
house and there's these zombies that are
ambling towards it along different lanes

54
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:39,562
of grass. And you have to click on seed
pods and put different kinds of plants

55
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:44,178
down that shoot things at the zombies. And
you get sunflowers that capture sunlight,

56
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:48,821
and that gets you more seeds, and all
this. It sounds really weird, first of

57
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:53,291
all, and also kind of complicated. But the
onboarding process and the scaffolding

58
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:58,440
process of the game makes it easy in just
a few minutes for anyone to figure it out

59
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,106
and to get to the point where they can go
to the next level of complexity until

60
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:07,044
ultimately the training wheels come off
and the game gives you the full

61
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:11,004
experience. So, that's onboarding and
scaffolding. And then ultimately, the

62
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:15,965
challenge down the road is to keep the
game interesting to get the player up to

63
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:21,302
the level of mastery. The second key to
effective game design. Second design rule

64
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:26,316
that I'll talk about is balance. Games
have to be balanced. Not too hard. Not too

65
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:31,976
easy. Not too many choices. Not too few
choices. All kinds of balance that have to

66
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:37,628
be in the game. Also, not too easy for one
player and not too easy for the other

67
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:42,847
player. There has to be a sense of
competition that either player could win.

68
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:47,246
Balance is something that games need at
every stage. A game can start off in

69
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:51,520
balance and then quickly become imbalanced
and then fall apart. So, a lot of game

70
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,030
design is about ensuring that the game is
constantly in balance. It's tricky,

71
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,145
because the players are real people. You
don't know exactly what they're going to

72
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:04,319
do. You have to play test the game to see
what happens and ensure that the game

73
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,210
doesn't get out of balance because at that
point it's not fun for at least one of the

74
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,947
players. So let's think about a game that
you may have played. The game being

75
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:19,878
Monopoly. You see it back there behind me
on the shelf. And in Monopoly, you go

76
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:25,810
around this game board that has four
sides. And it's divided up into various

77
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,390
tiles. And th ere are properties and
things like railroads and utilities and

78
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:37,056
places you draw cards and so forth, at
different places here on the board. And

79
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:43,278
all of those things have prices associated
with them or at least the houses do, and

80
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:49,557
the properties do, and they vary. So,
think about it. What if Boardwalk is our

81
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:55,262
call Boardwalk is somewhere down over
here. If Boardwalk costs twice as much,

82
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:59,091
how would the game change? Well it would
be a whole lot better if you owned

83
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:04,001
boardwalk and a whole lot worse if you
didn't. And it's impossible for me to say

84
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:08,021
in the abstract, is the price of Boardwalk
too low or too high. But if you play the

85
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:12,044
game enough times, you will find out at a
certain price, it's too high. The game is

86
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:16,058
ultimately not going to be fun for whoever
doesn't get Boardwalk, that's just a

87
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:19,898
matter of chance. The game will be out of
balance. So, with all the properties in

88
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:25,017
the game the challenge is keep the numbers
in balance so that it's fun for people to

89
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:29,036
play and also people of different skill
levels. The other piece of balance which

90
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:34,043
is not quite so obvious is this square
right here. Which in Monopoly says, go on

91
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:40,401
it. And as you probably know if you played
Monopoly, when you pass Go, you get $200.

92
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:46,810
Whoopie for me, I get $200. Why is that in
the game? Why is the game has to give you

93
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,968
money. The reason is balance. The reason
is that if money were not continuously

94
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:58,673
injected into the game, the players would
quickly run out. There's not enough money

95
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:02,812
built into the game to keep it going,
given all the properties you have to buy.

96
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:07,514
And if the game started you off with two
or three times as much money as you

97
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:12,604
started with, then the game would be too
easy. So, the game has to keep the economy

98
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:17,560
in balance. It's like a real economy.
People are buying things and people are

99
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,832
getting money and if the, balance between
those two things gets out of whack, we

100
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:26,218
have inflation. Or it becomes too
difficult for people to buy things, and

101
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:30,712
then we have something like a recession.
So, the game of Monopoly has to maintain

102
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:36,004
balance in the virtual economy b y
interject, by injecting $200 Into the

103
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:42,005
economy each time you pass Go. That's the
function of that within the game, it's all

104
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:46,069
about balance. So, same thing in
gamification. If you're trying to

105
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:52,027
encourage people to do something on your
website or trying to encourage your

106
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:57,084
employees to engage in some practice, it
needs to always be designed in a way

107
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:03,042
that's not too hard, not too easy, doesn't
necessarily favor one group systematically

108
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:08,039
over another. Third design rule for
gamification is to create an experience.

109
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:13,066
And this is at some level implicit in the
notion of gamification being about games,

110
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:18,092
but you want to take something that is not
game-like and make it feel game-like by

111
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:23,068
creating an integrated experience. So,
here is turntable.fm, a site that lets

112
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:28,012
people listen to music. Well, that's a
common thing on the web. But what

113
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:32,796
turntable.fm did in very clever ways was
essentially gamify this experience. So,

114
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:37,752
you go to this website, and there's some
music that's playing here, here's the, the

115
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:43,014
song that happens to be playing. But in
addition to the music itself that you

116
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:47,248
hear, you see this interface. You see a
group of people up at the top here who are

117
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:51,621
DJ, they're picking the music that gets
played. And then all the other people are

118
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:55,466
out here and you see these little very
simple avatars of their backs, they're

119
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:59,359
standing out there, they're in a club. So,
now all of a sudden you are not just

120
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:04,023
listening to music, you're in a club. And
you're in a club with a friend, a bunch of

121
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:08,064
friends. And you're in a club with a bunch
of people. Actual human beings here who

122
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:13,387
are picking the music. And you can rate
the music on this little thing down here

123
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:18,530
which lets you say the music is either
awesome or lame and then it gets a score

124
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:24,077
on this meter here. Of all of this
combines to reinforce the notion that your

125
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:30,056
involved not just in sitting and listening
to music in your home, but an experience

126
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:36,035
that you are in a particular kind of world
that means something and that makes the

127
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:41,733
act of listening to music somehow richer
and deeper then just going into IT unes

128
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:47,016
and clicking on one song or another.
That's a good example about how to use

129
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:51,041
gamification to change an experience
without really changing it. All

130
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:56,000
turntable.fm does is allow people to pick
music and other people to go into

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,054
different rooms to listen to it, but
they've created a game-like experience

132
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:03,081
around it that somehow makes it more fun
and engaging.
