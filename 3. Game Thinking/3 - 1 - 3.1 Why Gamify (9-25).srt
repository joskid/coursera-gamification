1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,086
I've talked some now about what
gamification is and about what games are.

2
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:11,041
It's time to get into the challenge of
thinking like a game designer,

3
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:18,016
understanding problems through the lens of
what I call game thinking, the core skill

4
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:24,010
for gamification. And I'd like to start
doing that by posing a fundamental

5
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:30,085
question. Why gamify? Why would you even
think to take a site or a business process

6
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:35,790
and try to make it more game-like if
you're interested in some serious results

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,007
and achieving some real world serious
objectives. So, let's look at an example

8
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:47,784
and try to think about why gamification
made sense for this service. The example

9
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:52,846
is Dodgeball. Dodgeball was one of the
first successful smart phone applications.

10
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:57,607
It was developed by a group of graduates
from the Interdisciplinary Technology

11
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:03,233
Program at NYU. And these guys like to
hang around in bars. So they built an app

12
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:09,005
for people who like to hang around in
bars. Here you see a screenshot of the web

13
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:14,341
client and Dodgeball gave you this map
that showed you where you were and then

14
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:19,217
you could check in. And say, here I am.
I'm at this location right here. This bar

15
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:23,340
that's on this street. And then you can
see where your friends were. Where other

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,619
people were who were using the application
where they had checked in. And this got

17
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:32,716
some notoriety. Started to get some pickup
in New York and San Francisco and places

18
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:37,658
like that. And in fact, Google bought the
company. But, Dodgeball had a problem. The

19
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:42,041
problem was that it's a chicken and egg
situation. If lots of your friends are on

20
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:46,857
Dodgeball, and there's lots of check-ins
that you can find, then there's a great

21
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:51,180
incentive for you to check-in as well. You
want to get access to all the information.

22
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,620
You get a lot of value from seeing all of
your friends and you know they will get a

23
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,123
lot of value from seeing what you're
doing. On the other hand, if you go to

24
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:05,324
Dodgeball and there's a blank map, not too
much reason for you to bother checking in.

25
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:10,874
So, how does the service get to critical
mass? Get above that level where there's a

26
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:16,214
not, not enough acti vity to get people
involved. So, that was one of the basic

27
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:21,665
challenges that Dodgeball had. After
leaving Google, Dennis Crowley, one of the

28
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:26,510
founders of Dodgeball started a new
company, they had a fairly similar basic

29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,896
structure. It involved going and checking
in on a mobile client at locations that

30
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:37,405
you would go to. But this time, his new
company, Foursquare implemented what we

31
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:42,086
would now call gamification. So think
about, why would Foursquare use

32
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:47,872
gamification? What are some of the aspects
of this service that we saw originally in

33
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:52,809
Dodgeball, that might lend themselves to a
gamified approach? There's a number of

34
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:58,038
different things that you might come up
with and there is clearly no right answer.

35
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:03,348
But let's think about some of the aspects
of this problem that might make

36
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:08,298
gamification appropriate. The first is
that Dodgeball had what we could call an

37
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:14,003
engagement gap. It needed to get more
people to engage within use the service

38
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:19,023
and making the service fun, making the
service feel more engaging and game-like

39
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:24,018
is certainly a powerful way to do that.
The second is that, Dodgeball didn't have

40
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:28,082
a lot of variety in it. Basically, it was
check-in or don't check-in and then again,

41
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:32,096
you could get some analytics or
information, as well as seeing where your

42
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:37,061
friends were checking in but there weren't
too many different things to do but there

43
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:42,003
weren't too many different things to do.
And when things are unitary like that,

44
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:46,050
where it's either do something or don't do
something, it doesn't tend to engage

45
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,015
people as much, unless there's some very
direct result that they get. If it's go to

46
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:55,012
this website, click a button buy this
product, then you can see the

47
00:03:55,012 --> 00:04:00,256
relationship. But if it's not that clear,
if there's some value in the exchange but

48
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:06,357
it's not as direct having options, having
choices as we talked about in discussing

49
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:11,780
games with meaningful choices could
potentially make the experience more

50
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,381
popular. And the next is that Dodgeball
didn't really have any progression.

51
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:21,192
Check-in or not, you really didn't get
anywhere by virtue of what you d id. And

52
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:26,359
so, checking in the hundredth time was
kind of like checking in the first time,

53
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:31,844
again limited the motivation of players to
want to participate actively in that

54
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:36,890
system. The good news is that Dodgeball
was a very social application. It involved

55
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,797
relationships with your friends. And
social interaction is very powerfully tied

56
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:46,284
to games because we love to compete
against our friends. We love to

57
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:51,622
collaborate, and share, and team up with
our friends. We love to have status visa

58
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:56,613
vis our friends and also see what our
friends our doing. And so all of that is

59
00:04:56,613 --> 00:05:02,258
potentially quite consistent with a
gamified approach. And finally, there was

60
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:08,027
an opportunity with a service like
Dodgeball to make the action a habit. If

61
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:12,962
you have to think each time, oh, I better
get out my phone and go and check-in,

62
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:17,185
you're not going to do it all that much.
If it's habitual, if it's just a natural

63
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:21,126
thing that you do, you just kind of
automatically when you go to a new bar or

64
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:25,688
a club or a restaurant or even one that
you've gone to many times before, you just

65
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:30,143
pull out your phone and check-in then
you're much more likely to do it. So the

66
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:34,137
challenge for Dodgeball and for its
successor, Foursquare was how to make this

67
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:38,433
action a habit. Something again that is
very well suited to games which create

68
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:43,061
this environment that encourages people to
come back and come back. So, those are few

69
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:48,074
of the reasons that I think gamification
seemed to make sense for Foursquare, the

70
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:53,720
successor service to Dodgeball. So let's
look at what Foursquare did. The most

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,522
prominent thing that it did was
implemented a concept called Mayorships.

72
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:03,276
So, if you check in the most times, out of
everyone who's checked in at that

73
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:08,467
particular location, [sound] you're the
Mayor on Foursquare. And here you see the

74
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:12,817
badge, badges is another aspect of
gamification in Foursquare I'll talk

75
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:17,300
about. This is the badge that you get for
being the mayor of ten locations at the

76
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,921
same time. It's actually the super mayor
badge. But it's a representation of that

77
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:26,394
achievement of becoming the mayor. And
Foursquare buil t a system that made it

78
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:30,615
very easy to notify your friends on
Twitter and Facebook that you've become

79
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:35,305
the mayor of a place, who you displaced as
the mayor. It created this friendly

80
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:40,867
competition which made the act of checking
in, something more fun and something that

81
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:45,474
had more of a reward to it. Not
necessarily a monetary reward, although

82
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:51,046
some venues do give incentives to people
who are mayors. But a reward in that you

83
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:56,773
see something and other people see that
you are on top when you become the mayor

84
00:06:56,773 --> 00:07:01,570
of a venue. Simple but potentially
valuable use of gamification. And then

85
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,101
Foursquare built a whole other set of game
mechanics around this check-in process. So

86
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:11,844
this was a screenshot from the Foursquare
page of Dennis Crowley, the CEO of

87
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:17,077
Foursquare. And you see a variety of data
points about what he's done. And then here

88
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:21,164
on the right you see the badges. Badges
were an important element of what

89
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:25,507
Foursquare did. They allowed them to
create much more richness of the service.

90
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:30,100
Remember I said choises are important and
progression is important. Badges gave all

91
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,648
sorts of options. Again, it's still just
checking in but now checking in becomes a

92
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:39,041
much more variated kind of activity. It
depends where you check in. If you check

93
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,459
in at a certain place like a health club,
you get a badge. If you check into the

94
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:48,776
health club a certain number of times, you
get another badge. If you check in at, say

95
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:53,572
a conference, like South by Southwest,
there are special purpose badges you get

96
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:58,295
that you can only get there. So suddenly,
this one act of checking in, becomes

97
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:02,935
something that seems very rich and complex
and nuanced for the users. It also is

98
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:07,556
something that allows you to level up. So,
Foursquare implemented different levels

99
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:12,518
within their badges, so checking into an
airport gives you one badge. But checking

100
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:16,621
into twenty different airports say, gives
you a higher level of that badge which is

101
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,871
harder to get. And Foursquare also had an
independent leveling system based on

102
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:25,634
points for number of check-ins which you
see here. Dennis was a super user le vel

103
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,360
three when this screen shot was taken. And
these are all examples of game mechanics

104
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,753
built around the basic process of checking
in. Did it work? Well, Foursquare now has

105
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:40,508
over twenty million users. They've raised
over $70 million in venture capital,

106
00:08:40,508 --> 00:08:44,841
valuing the company over $600 million and
they've successfully overcome challenges

107
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:49,826
from major companies like Facebook that
got into this social location marketplace.

108
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:55,050
Now, Facebook Foursquare still has a long
way to go and correlation isn't causation.

109
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,009
That doesn't necessarily tell us that the
game mechanics were the reason for their

110
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:04,590
success. This is something that will come
back to later. But it's worth thinking

111
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,996
about how the gamification that Foursquare
implemented ties back to the challenges

112
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:14,931
that they face. So, consider how
gamification addressed the engagement gap,

113
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:20,489
the desire for habit formation, the need
for more choices and more progression, and

114
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:26,474
taking advantage of the social dimension
of what Four Square was doing. That's the

115
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:33,560
kind of thought process that you need to
engage in, in approaching problems through

116
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,000
the lens of game design.
