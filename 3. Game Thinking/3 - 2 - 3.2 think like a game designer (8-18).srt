1
00:00:00,25 --> 00:00:05,320
The key scale in gamification is thinking 
like a game designer. 

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,965
In other words, viewing your business 
problem or other kind of challenge. 

3
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:13,871
In the same way a game designer would 
think about the challenge involved in 

4
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:17,990
creating a game. 
So what exactly does it mean to think 

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,862
like a game designer? 
Jesse Schell, in his book, The Art of 

6
00:00:21,862 --> 00:00:26,193
Game Design, a book of lenses, urges 
anyone interested in becoming a game 

7
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:31,464
designer to utter five words. 
Now, he was talking about anyone who 

8
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,708
wants to go into the actual field of game 
design. 

9
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:38,242
But the five words are relevant for 
people who are thinking about applying 

10
00:00:38,242 --> 00:00:41,850
game design lessons through gamification 
as well. 

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,290
And the words are the following, I am a 
game designer, pretty simple. 

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,920
It reminds us that game design is a state 
of mind. 

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,365
And hopefully it reminds us that game 
design is something that pretty much all 

14
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:59,992
of us have already done. 
Kids on the playground make up games all 

15
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:03,277
the time. 
Making up games is something that comes 

16
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:06,938
naturally as human beings. 
But, like a lot of things, we don't 

17
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:10,260
necessarily think about it in a 
systematic way. 

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,610
We don't realize that it's something 
that's a skill that we can cultivate. 

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,681
So thinking like a game designer first of 
all involves resolving that you are going 

20
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:23,180
to look at your problem in the same way 
as a game designer. 

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,697
So if your goal is to get more people to 
come to your website. 

22
00:01:27,697 --> 00:01:32,167
Or your goal is to figure out how to pick 
the best employees. 

23
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:36,693
Or your goal is to try to promote 
innovation within your company, whatever 

24
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:42,330
it is, think about that as a game. 
It's still real, it's still important. 

25
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,457
But, if that were a game that the 
particpants were playing, and you were 

26
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:50,340
designing what would you do? 
Now two caveats about what this means. 

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,556
The first is it doesn't necessarily mean 
to think like a game designer that you're 

28
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:58,750
actually going to become one. 
Game design is hard and it has many 

29
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,70
different facets, especially if we're 
talking about modern video game design. 

30
00:02:03,70 --> 00:02:08,200
It requires tremendous technicial skills 
in different areas. 

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,570
It requires illustrations and sound and 
storytelling. 

32
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:19,620
And many other aspects that require 
serious skill in different areas to do. 

33
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,276
You don't have to do all of those things. 
And frankly, you don't have to do any of 

34
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:28,250
those things specifically, to employ game 
design techniques in gamification. 

35
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,685
I often talk to people in companies who 
get scared when I say. 

36
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:35,30
Gamification means putting yourself in 
the shoes of a game designer. 

37
00:02:35,30 --> 00:02:39,734
Because they say oh, I haven't gone and 
gotten a master's degree in game design. 

38
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:43,850
Or developed the skills that it takes 
technically to build a game. 

39
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,992
That's not the point. 
The point is if you're going to approach 

40
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:51,300
things through the lens of game design. 
You're going to have an orientation 

41
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,99
towards the problem that's different than 
if you were approaching them. 

42
00:02:55,99 --> 00:02:57,890
Through another way i may say just as a 
business manager. 

43
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:03,262
Third point is that thinking like a game 
designer is different than thinking like 

44
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:06,394
a gamer. 
Thinking like a gamer, means playing a 

45
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,756
game. 
And as I've talked about we're all gamers 

46
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:12,360
pretty much, we all play games in one way 
or another. 

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,440
If you're playing a game, you're 
typically not thinking about the 

48
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,790
structure of the game. 
That's what the game does. 

49
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,828
It creates this immersive experience, 
this state of flow that carries you 

50
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,300
along. 
And you don't really want to pull back 

51
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,960
the curtain and think about the nuts and 
bolts of how the game got made. 

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,339
On the other hand, if you're the game 
designer that's exactly what you're 

53
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:34,180
focused on. 
What you care about is not the experience 

54
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,694
of what it feels like. 
That's the ultimate objective, but in 

55
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:40,867
order to get there. 
What you have to do is think about the 

56
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:45,270
components that you need to put together 
to create that experience. 

57
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,854
So that's what thinking like a game 
designer means, always paying attention 

58
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:53,990
to the structures and the frameworks of 
the game as opposed to the experience. 

59
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,434
The game is not the experience. 
The experience is what it feels like to 

60
00:03:57,434 --> 00:04:01,50
play the game and yes, that's ultimately 
the objective. 

61
00:04:01,50 --> 00:04:04,649
But the game involves all of the 
structures that it takes to create that 

62
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:08,550
experience. 
So, how do you think like a game 

63
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,412
designer? 
The key starting point is to think about 

64
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:17,510
the people that are involved in your game 
as players. 

65
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,338
Whether those are customers, employees, 
some community that you're trying to 

66
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:24,549
mobilize. 
Or some population that you're trying to 

67
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:29,120
encourage to engage in some behavior 
change, whoever it is. 

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,11
You need to say, these are my players, 
because words matter. 

69
00:04:33,11 --> 00:04:36,659
And when you think of someone as a 
player, it's subtly different than 

70
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:41,830
thinking about them as say, a customer, 
or even worse, a consumer. 

71
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,222
What's a consumer? 
It's someone who consumes, and so 

72
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:47,732
therefore the producer puts something out 
there, and the consumer passively 

73
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:51,410
consumes it. 
Customer is a little bit more active. 

74
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,960
People in the computer industry like to 
use the term user. 

75
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,650
People in certain retail industries now 
use the term guest. 

76
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,10
That has that nice notion that you're 
inviting someone into your house. 

77
00:05:01,10 --> 00:05:04,874
All of those have certain subtle 
implications for the nature of the 

78
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:08,540
relationship. 
In game design. 

79
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,184
The relationship is between the designer 
and a player. 

80
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:14,100
So, what does it mean for someone to be a 
player? 

81
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,573
Well, the first thing it means is that 
players are the center of the game, the 

82
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:23,546
game revolves around the player. 
Even though the game was built by a 

83
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:27,434
company or group of game designers. 
To serve some purpose, which maybe is 

84
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:32,280
just making money for that company. 
From the players' standpoint, it's about 

85
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,620
them. 
You as the player are the one who is in 

86
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,560
the middle of the game, and the world 
revolves around you. 

87
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,130
Whatever is happening in that game, it's 
all about you, the player. 

88
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,150
So think about how to build your business 
in a way that the player is at the 

89
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,703
center. 
Second, try to realize how players need 

90
00:05:55,703 --> 00:06:02,312
to feel that they are in control. 
So, a, a game creates an environment 

91
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:07,159
where player feels autonomy. 
I'll talk more about this when I discuss 

92
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:11,130
self determination theory and some of the 
psychology around games. 

93
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,882
But the point is, the player needs to 
have the sense, not only that everything 

94
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:18,195
revolves around them. 
But that they can make choices and the 

95
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:21,646
choices have results. 
Again, meaningful choices, as we 

96
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:24,370
mentioned before, in talking about the 
nature of games. 

97
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,615
So think about how do you create an 
environment so that your customers, 

98
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:33,80
users, whatever you call them, feel like 
they're the ones who are driving? 

99
00:06:33,80 --> 00:06:37,785
And that the choices they make by their 
own free will have some real impact. 

100
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:41,628
That causes some meaning, and meaning 
doesn't necessarily mean financial 

101
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:44,549
benefit. 
It means something that they care about 

102
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:48,602
that they are willing, at that moment, to 
think of as being valuable. 

103
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:53,970
Finally, what do players do? 
They Play. 

104
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,460
That's kind of evident in the word 
players, but it's important. 

105
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,350
And as I've talked about, play is not the 
same things as games. 

106
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,705
Play is a sense of free motion within a 
set of constraints that exuberates energy 

107
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:09,890
that doesn't necessarily have to have a 
purpose. 

108
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,555
If you think of your customers or users 
as players. 

109
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:18,637
You'll try to think about ways where they 
have that freedom to feel like they are 

110
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:23,492
at play. 
The goal of a game designer is to create 

111
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:28,180
that sense of play for a specific 
purpose. 

112
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,870
And the purpose is one, to get into the 
game. 

113
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,164
To get them playing. 
And two, to keep them playing. 

114
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:43,718
Related, but distinct challenges. 
So if you think like a game designer, the 

115
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:48,770
first thing that you stay up at night 
thinking about is how do I get people in? 

116
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,645
How do I make it enticing. 
And how do I create an experience that 

117
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:58,10
makes it easy and simple and smooth for 
someone to get into the experience. 

118
00:07:58,10 --> 00:08:01,940
And secondly, once they're in, how do I 
keep them there? 

119
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,576
And not, how do I trick them. 
But how do I create an experience that 

120
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:10,20
will genuinely engage them for an 
extended period of time. 

121
00:08:10,20 --> 00:08:13,732
If you do those things, then you are 
thinking, not just like a business person 

122
00:08:13,732 --> 00:08:18,783
or a manager of some other process. 
But like someone who's designing a game.
